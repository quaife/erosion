\section{Introduction\label{s:intro}}
A continuation of the methods paper~\cite{qua-moo2018}.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\paragraph{Contributions}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Use novel near-singular Barycentric integration scheme for
    Stokes equation outlined in~\cite{bar-wu-vee2015}.
  \item Need to compute one additional derivative since we need the
    derivative of the velocity to find the vorticity and stress tensor
  \item Tracer trajectories at different time steps
  \item Compute the anomalous diffusion rate using similar techniques as
    the paper with Pietro~\cite{dea-qua-bir-jua2018}
  \item Need a novel way to do time stepping through the complex
    geometry
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Limitations}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Bodies are still pinned
  \item Bodies are still two dimensional
\end{itemize}

\section{Formulation}
\label{s:formulation}
Similar to the JCP methods paper.  However, need to put everything into
complex variables formulation so that we can use Barycentric ideas.
