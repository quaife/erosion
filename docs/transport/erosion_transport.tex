\section{Boundary Integral Equation Formulation}
\label{s:formulation}
Continuing on our previous work~\cite{qua-moo2018}, we use a completed
double-layer potential formulation for the velocity $\uu$.  The
double-layer potential is
\begin{align}
  \DDD[\eeta](\xx) = \frac{1}{\pi}\int_{\bd\Omega} 
    \frac{\rr \cdot \nn}{\rho^2} \frac{\rr \otimes \rr}{\rho^2}
    \eeta(\yy) \, ds_\yy, \quad \xx \in \Omega,
  \label{eqn:stokesDLP}
\end{align}
where $\rr = \xx - \yy$, $\rho = \|\rr\|$, $\nn$ is the unit outward
normal at $\yy$, and $\eeta$ is an unknown density function.  The Stokes
double-layer potential can be as the sum of the Laplace double-layer
potential and its gradient.  By identifying $\xx,\yy \in \RR^2$ with the
points $x,y \in \CC$, the Laplace double-layer potential for a
real-valued density function $\eta$ can also be written as the real part
of the Cauchy integral
\begin{align}
  \DD[\eta](\xx) = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{\bd\Omega}
    \frac{\rr \cdot \nn}{\rho^2} \eta(\yy) ds_\yy = 
  \Re \left( \frac{1}{2\pi i} \int_{\bd\Omega}
    \frac{\eta(y)}{x - y} \, dy \right).
\end{align}
Therefore, the Stokes double-layer potential can be written in terms of
Cauchy integrals and its first derivative.  In addition, we also require
expressions for the derivative of the velocity field which can be
written in terms of a Cauchy integral and its first two derivatives.
Therefore, we introduce the notation
\begin{align}
  \label{eqn:cauchy}
  v[\eta](x) = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \int_{\bd\Omega}
    \frac{\eta(y)}{x - y} \, dy,  \quad
  v'[\eta](x) = -\frac{1}{2\pi i} \int_{\bd\Omega}
    \frac{\eta(y)}{(x - y)^2} \, dy, \quad
  v''[\eta](x) = \frac{1}{\pi i} \int_{\bd\Omega}
    \frac{\eta(y)}{(x - y)^3} \, dy.
\end{align}
To simplify notation, whenever it will not cause confusion, we exclude
$\tau$ and instead write $v(x)$, $v'(x)$, and $v''(x)$.

The Stokes double-layer potential itself can not represent all solutions
of the incompressible Stokes equations.  Therefore, we complete the
integral equation formulation following the work of Power and
Miranda~\cite{pow-mir1987}.  The completion depends on the Stokeslets
and rotlets
\begin{align}
  S[\llambda_\ell,\cc_\ell](\xx) = \frac{1}{4\pi} \left( 
    -\log \rho \II + \frac{\rr \otimes \rr}{\rho^2} \right), \quad
  R[\xi_\ell,\cc_\ell](\xx) = \frac{\rr^\perp}{\rho^2} \xi_\ell,
\end{align}
where $\rr = \xx - \cc_\ell$, $\cc_\ell$ is a point inside the
$\ell^{th}$ eroding body, $\rr^\perp = (r_2,-r_1)$, and $\rho =
\|\rr\|$.  Then, the solution of the Stokes equation is
\begin{align}
  \uu(\xx) = \DDD[\eeta](\xx) + 
    \sum_{\ell=1}^M S[\llambda_\ell,\cc_\ell](\xx) + 
    \sum_{\ell=1}^M R[\xi_\ell,\cc_\ell](\xx),
\end{align}
where the density function, Stokeslets, and rotlets satisfy
\begin{align}
  \ff(\xx) &= -\frac{1}{2}\eeta(\xx) + \DDD[\eeta](\xx) + 
    \sum_{\ell=1}^M S[\llambda_\ell,\cc_\ell](\xx) + 
    \sum_{\ell=1}^M R[\xi_\ell,\cc_\ell](\xx) +
    \NN_0(\eeta](\xx), \quad \xx \in \bd\Omega, \\
  \llambda_\ell &= \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{\gamma_\ell} 
    \eeta(\yy) ds_\yy \quad \ell = 1,\ldots,M, \\
  \xi_\ell &= \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{\gamma_\ell}
    (\yy - \cc_\ell)^\perp \cdot \eeta(\yy) ds_\yy 
    \quad \ell = 1,\ldots,M,
\end{align}
where $\ff$ is the prescribed Dirichlet boundary condition of the
velocity on the outer wall and eroding bodies.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Cauchy Integral Representation of the Double-Layer
Potential}
The Stokes double-layer potential~\eqref{eqn:stokesDLP} can be
decomposed as
\begin{align}
  \DDD[\eeta](\xx) &= 
    \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{\Gamma} 
      \frac{\nn}{\rho^2} (\rr \cdot \eeta) \, ds_\yy + 
    \frac{1}{2\pi} \nabla \int_{\Gamma}
      \frac{\rr \cdot \nn}{\rho^2} (\yy \cdot \eeta) \, ds_\yy \\
    &- \frac{1}{2\pi} x_1 \nabla \int_{\Gamma}
      \frac{\rr \cdot \nn}{\rho^2}\eta_1(\yy) \, ds_\yy -
    \frac{1}{2\pi} x_2 \nabla \int_{\Gamma}
      \frac{\rr \cdot \nn}{\rho^2}\eta_2(\yy) \, ds_\yy.
\end{align}
All these integrals but the first are a gradient of a Laplace layer
potential with the density functions $\eta_1$, $\eta_2$, and $\yy \cdot
\eeta$.  In addition, each component of the first integral can be
written as a Cauchy integral with a complex-valued
densities~\cite{bar-wu-vee2015}.  Therefore, the Stokes double-layer
potential can be written as five Cauchy integrals and their derivatives
with the density functions $\yy \cdot \eeta$, $\eta_1$, and $\eta_2$.
The individual velocity components are
\begin{align}
  u_1(\xx) &= \Re (v[\tau_1](x)) + \Re (v'[\yy\cdot\eeta](x)) 
           -x_1\Re (v'[\eta_1](x)) - x_2\Re (v'[\eta_2](x)),\\
  u_2(\xx) &= \Re (v[\tau_2](x)) - \Im (v'[\yy\cdot\eeta](x)) 
       +x_1\Im (v'[\eta_1](x)) + x_2\Im (v'[\eta_2](x)),
\end{align}
where
\begin{align} 
  \tau_1=(\eta_1+i\eta_2)\frac{\Re(n)}{n}, \quad \text{and} \quad
  \tau_2=(\eta_1+i\eta_2)\frac{\Im(n)}{n},
\end{align}
and $n \in \CC$ is the complex representation of $\nn \in \RR^2$

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Cauchy Integral Representation of the Shear Stress}
To compute the rate of erosion, we must compute the shear stress of the
double-layer potential
\begin{align}
  \tau(\xx) = \left(\nabla \DDD[\eeta](\xx) + 
    \nabla^T \DDD[\eeta](\xx) \right) \nn \cdot \ss,
\end{align}
where $\nn$ and $\ss$ are the unit normal and tangent vectors at $\xx$,
respectively.  Each term of the gradient of the velocity field can be
written in terms of Cauchy integrals as
\todo[inline]{not clear enough how we got these equations.  Need to show
how we do one of them and say the rest are calculated similarly.}
\begin{align}
  \pderiv{u_1}{x_1}(\xx) &= \Re (v'[\tau_1](x)) + 
    \Re (v''[\yy\cdot\eeta](x)) - \Re (v'[\eta_1](x)) - 
    x_1\Re (v''[\eta_1](x)) - x_2\Re (v''[\eta_2](x)), \\
  \pderiv{u_1}{x_2}(\xx) &= - \Im (v'[\tau_1](x)) - 
    \Im (v''[\yy\cdot\eeta](x)) + \Im (v''[\eta_1](x)) - 
    \Re (v'[\eta_2](x)) + x_2\Im (v''[\eta_2](x)), \\
  \pderiv{u_2}{x_1}(\xx) &= \Re (v'[\tau_2](x)) - 
    \Im (v''[\yy\cdot\eeta](x)) + \Im (v'[\eta_1](x)) +
    x_1\Im (v''[\eta_1](x)) + x_2\Im (v''[\eta_2](x)), \\
  \pderiv{u_2}{x_2}(\xx) &= -\Im (v'[\tau_2](x)) - 
    \Re (v''[\yy\cdot\eeta](x)) + x_1\Re (v''[\eta_1](x)) +
    \Im (v'[\eta_2](x)) + x_2\Re (v''[\eta_2](x)).
\end{align}
\todo[inline]{S-H: last term seems to be missing an $x_1$.  Some of the
other terms seem to be a bit off.  It might be partially my fault from
when I updated some of the tex.}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Cauchy Integral Representation of the Vorticity}
Having calculated all derivatives of the double-layer potential, the
vorticity can written in terms of Cauchy integrals.  In particular
\begin{align}
  \omega(x) = \pderiv{u_2}{x_1} - \pderiv{u_1}{x_2} = 
\end{align}
\todo[inline]{For S-H to fill in}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Cauchy Integral Representation of the Pressure}
The pressure of the double-layer potential is
\begin{align}
  p(\xx) = -\frac{1}{\pi} \int_{\bd\Omega} \frac{1}{\rho^2}
    \left(1 - 2 \frac{\rr \otimes \rr}{\rho^2} \right) \nn
    \cdot \eeta(\yy) \, ds_\yy.
\end{align}

\section{Transport, Tracers, and Tortuosity}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Erosion leads to interesting porous geometries, and we are interested in
characterizing transport in these geometries.  To characterize the
transport, we first require tracer trajectories (streamlines) that are
governed by
\begin{align}
  \frac{d\ss}{dt} = \uu(\ss,t), \quad \ss(0) = \ss_0.
\end{align}
Instead of allowing the transport and erosion to happen simultaneously,
we freeze the geometry and compute the streamlines in this fixed
geometry.  Therefore, the velocity $\uu$ has no temporal dependence when
we characterize the transport.

The tortuosity measures ...


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Numerical Methods}
\label{s:method}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
We are interested in computing the velocity, shear stress, vorticity,
and pressure of the Stokes double-layer potential.  We have shown that
all these quantities can be written in terms of Cauchy integrals and its
first two derivatives.  Therefore, we require quadrature methods to
evaluate the expressions in equation~\eqref{eqn:cauchy}.  The trapezoid
rule is appropriate if the integrands are sufficiently smooth, where the
smoothness depends on the number of discretization points.  However,
given a fixed resolution, if the target point $\xx$ is too close to $\bd
\Omega$, the trapezoid rule becomes inaccurate and the overall method is
unstable.  There have been a variety of near-singular integration
schemes developed, and we extend a method first outlined by Barnett et
al.~\cite{bar-wu-vee2015} which we will call the {\em Barycentric
quadrature rule}.  Here, we briefly describe this quadrature method, and
then derive a necessary extension to simulate erosion.

The Barycentric quadrature rule starts with a general quadrature rule
for $v(x)$
\begin{align}
  v(x) \approx \frac{1}{2\pi i} \sum_{j=1}^N 
    w_j \frac{\tau(y_j)}{x - y_j},
\end{align}
where $w_j$ are the quadrature weights and $y_j \in \Gamma$ are the
quadrature nodes.  We will use the trapezoid rule because of its
superior accuracy when $x$ is sufficiently far from $\Gamma$.  However,
for a fixed resolution $N$, the error grows without bound as $x$
approaches $\Gamma$.  As outline by Barnett et
al.~\cite{bar-wu-vee2015}, the error is uniformly bounded if the
Barycentric quadrature rule
\begin{align}
  v(x) \approx \frac{\sum\limits_{j=1}^N \frac{v_j^-}{y_j-x}w_j}
    {\sum\limits_{j=1}^N \frac{1}{y_j-x}w_j}
  \quad \text{and} \quad
  v'(x) \approx \frac{\sum\limits_{j=1}^N 
    \frac{v_j^- - v(x)}{(y_j - x)^2}w_j}
    {\sum\limits_{j=1}^N \frac{1}{y_j-x}w_j}, 
\end{align}
is used, where $x$ is a target point that is interior to $\Gamma$,
and $v_j^-$ is the value of $v(y_j)$.  Modifications of this formula
exist if $x$ is exterior to $\Gamma$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Barycentric Quadrature for $v''(x)$}
While accurate quadrature rules for $v(x)$ and $v'(x)$ have already been
developed~\cite{bar-wu-vee2015}, this work requires a similar quadrature
rule for $v''(x)$.  We mimic the approach developed
in~\cite{bar-wu-vee2015} by starting with the identities
\todo[inline]{S-H: How do we get these identities?}
\begin{alignat}{3}
  0 &= \frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{\Gamma} 
    \frac{2v^-({ y})-2v(x)-2(y-x)v'(x)-(y-x)^2v''(x)}{(y-x)^3} dy, &&x \in \Omega, \\
  0 &= \frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{\Gamma}
    \frac{2v^+(y)-2v(x)-2(y-x)v'(x)-(y-a)^{-1}(x-a)(y-x)^2 v''(x)}
    {(y-x)^3} dy, \quad &&x \in \Omega^c.  \label{eqn:Identity}
\end{alignat}
{\color{red}
and the quadrature formulations are
\begin{alignat}{3}
  v''(x) &\approx
    \frac{2\sum\limits_{j=1}^N \frac{v_j^- -v(x)-(y_j-x)v'(x)}{(y_j-x)^3}w_j}
    {\sum\limits_{j=1}^N \frac{1}{y_j-x}w_j}, &&x \in \Omega, \\
  v''(x) &\approx \frac{1}{x-a}\frac{2\sum\limits_{j=1}^N
    \frac{v_j^+ -v(x)-(y_j-x)v'(x)}{(y_j-x)^3}}{\sum\limits_{j=1}^N \frac{(y_j-a)^{-1}}{y_j-x}w_j}
    , \quad &&x \in \Omega^c.  \label{eqn:SecondBary}
\end{alignat}
where $a$ is a point inside the $\Omega$ in equations~\eqref{eqn:Identity} and \eqref{eqn:SecondBary}.

\subsection{Fast Summation Methods}
\label{sec:fmm}

{\color{red}
By using Barycentric quadrature rule to approach integrations, we get a reasonable(?) double-layer potential and quantities of interest at target points but it requires $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ operations per target point which is computational expensive if we impose it on all the target points. In order to accelerate the process and keep the accuracy, it is a compromise that we use Barycentric quadrature rule to approach the nearly singular integratons but apply trapezoid rule when the target point is far from source points. 


To numerically compute the completed double-layer potential, we discretize each of the $M$ bodies with  $N_\iin$ points, and the outer boundary with $N_\out$ points. The following is the four-step fast summation methods.
}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Apply trapezoid rule as a first pass

{\color{red} We use the Fast Multipole Method (FMM)~\cite{gre-rok1987, gre-gre-may1992} with trapezoid rule to calculate the double-layer potential.
}
  \item Efficiently find points that are too close for trapezoid

{\color{red}
 Let $L_w$ be the length of the outer boundary and $L_{b}$ be the length of the boundary of body where $b=1, \cdots, M$. Here are the criteria to see if two points are too close for trapezoid. For criterion of outer boundary to body,  let $d$ be the minimum distance between outer boundary and a point $x$ on the body $b$, we say $x$ is too close to outer boundary if
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:Cw2b}
d<\frac{L_{b}}{2\pi} + \alpha_1\frac{L_w}{N_\out}
\end{equation}
where $\alpha_1$ is a constant. 
For criterion between two bodies, let $d$ be the distance between the centroid $a$ of the body $b_1$ and a point $x$ on the body $b_2$, we say they are too close if
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:Cb2b}
d<\frac{L_{b_1}}{2\pi}+\frac{L_{b_2}}{2\pi}+\alpha_2\left(\frac{L_{b_1}}{N_\iin}+\frac{L_{b_2}}{N_\iin}\right)
\end{equation}
where $\alpha_2$ is a constant. 

}
  \item Subtract off trapezoid rule directly
  \item Add on Barycentric directly
\end{itemize}
{\color{red}  (Discussion of the choices of $\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_2$ with respect to accuracy and  efficiency)

To find the suitable values of $\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_2$ in~\eqref{eqn:Cw2b} and \eqref{eqn:Cb2b}, we set $\alpha_1=\alpha_2=1, 2, 3$, and $4$ to test the criteria on a 20-body problem with $N_\out = 1024$ and $N_\iin = 128, 256$, and $512$. To check the accuracy of the simulations, we use the solution calculated by \todo[inline]{what method} to \todo[inline]{...}
To see how efficient our code is, we record the cpu time for each step.

%add an introduction why we do not use the double-layer potentials of stokes equations but the double-layer potentials of laplace equations to solve stokes equation when we use barycentric approach (or complex variable approach).
%
%\subsubsection{laplace's equations from $\rdb^2$ to $\cdb$ }
%
%let $\omega$ be the domain of fluid. the boundary of $\omega$ is $\gamma$ and the outward normal vector on $\gamma$ is ${\bf n_y}=(n_1,n_2)$.

%consider a laplace's equations with dirichlet boundary condition

%\subsubsection{From Stokes DLP to Laplace DLPs}
%
%Let ${\bf x}=(x_1,x_2), {\bf y}=(y_1,y_2)$. Then we have ${\bf r}={\bf x} - {\bf y}$ and $\rho=|\bf r|$.
%
%
%The Stokes double-layer potential  is
%\begin{equation}\label{StokesDLP1}
%\D[\boldsymbol\sigma]({\bf x}):=\frac{1}{\pi}\int_{\Gamma}\left(\frac{{\bf r} \cdot {\bf n_y}}{\rho^2}\frac{{\bf r} \otimes {\bf r}}{\rho^2}\right) {\boldsymbol\sigma({\bf y})} d s_y.
%\end{equation}
%We could rewrite the Stokes DLP in terms of the Laplace DLP as
%\begin{align*}\label{StokesDLP2}
%\D[\boldsymbol\sigma]({\bf x})=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{\Gamma}&\frac{{\bf n_y}}{\rho^2}({\bf r} \cdot {\boldsymbol \sigma})ds_y+\frac{1}{2\pi}\nabla\int_{\Gamma}\frac{{\bf r} \cdot {\bf n_y}}{\rho^2}({\bf y} \cdot{\boldsymbol \sigma})ds_y\\
%&-\frac{1}{2\pi}x_1 \nabla\int_{\Gamma}\frac{{\bf r} \cdot {\bf n_y}}{\rho^2}\sigma_1ds_y-\frac{1}{2\pi}x_2\nabla\int_{\Gamma}\frac{{\bf r} \cdot {\bf n_y}}{\rho^2}\sigma_2ds_y. \numberthis
