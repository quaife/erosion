\section{Introduction\label{s:intro}}
A continuation of the methods paper~\cite{qua-moo2018}.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\paragraph{Contributions}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Use novel near-singular Barycentric integration scheme for
    Stokes equation outlined in~\cite{bar-wu-vee2015}.
  \item Need to compute one additional derivative since we need the
    derivative of the velocity to find the vorticity and stress tensor
  \item Tracer trajectories at different time steps
  \item Compute the anomalous diffusion rate using similar techniques as
    the paper with Pietro~\cite{dea-qua-bir-jua2018}
  \item Need a novel way to do time stepping through the complex
    geometry
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Limitations}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Bodies are still pinned
  \item Bodies are still two dimensional
\end{itemize}

\section{Formulation}
\label{s:formulation}
Similar to the JCP methods paper.  However, need to put everything into
complex variables formulation so that we can use Barycentric ideas.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Boundary integral equation formulation} 
\label{sec:bies}
Add an introduction why we do not use the double-layer potentials of Stokes equations but the double-layer potentials of Laplace equations to solve Stokes equation when we use Barycentric approach (or complex variable approach).
\subsubsection{Laplace's equations from $\Rdb^2$ to $\Cdb$ }

Let $\Omega$ be the domain of fluid. The boundary of $\Omega$ is $\Gamma$ and the outward normal vector on $\Gamma$ is ${\bf n_y}=(n_1,n_2)$.

Consider a Laplace's equations with Dirichlet boundary condition
\begin{equation}\label{Laplace}
  \begin{cases}
    \Delta {\bf u}=0, & \text{in}\,\,\, \Omega \in \Rdb^2;\\
    {\bf u}={\bf f}, & \text{on}\,\,\, \Gamma.
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}

Let ${\bf x}=(x_1,x_2), {\bf y}=(y_1,y_2)$. Then we have ${\bf r}={\bf x} - {\bf y}$ and $\rho=|\bf r|$.
The double-layer potential which solves \eqref{Laplace} is 
\begin{align*}
\D[\sigma]({\bf x})&=\frac{1}{2\pi}\displaystyle\int_{\Gamma} \frac{{\bf r} \cdot {\bf n_y}}{\rho^2}\sigma({\bf y})dS_y,
%\frac{1}{2\pi}\displaystyle\int_{\Gamma}\frac{\partial}{\partial {\bf n_y}} \log |{\bf x}-{\bf y}| \sigma({\bf y})dS_y,\\ \\
%&=\frac{-1}{2\pi}\int_{\Gamma}\frac{{\bf r}\cdot{\bf n_y}}{\rho^2} \sigma({\bf y})dS_y\\ \\
%&=\frac{-1}{2\pi}\int_{\Gamma}\frac{n_1(x_1-y_1)+n_2(x_2-y_2)}{(x_1-y_1)^2+(x_2-y_2)^2} \sigma({\bf y})dS_y 
\numberthis\label{DLP:real}
\end{align*}
where $\sigma$ is the density function on the boundary $\Gamma$.


Consider a Cauchy integral 
\begin{equation}\label{CI}
v({x})=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{\Gamma}\frac{\sigma({ y})}{{ y}-{ x}} d{ y},\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, \forall { x} \in \Cdb\setminus \Gamma.
\end{equation}
where ${ x}=x_1+ix_2$, $ { y}=y_1+iy_2$, ${ n_y}=n_1+i n_2$ and $d{ y}=i {n_y}dS_y$. It is easy to show that 
the real part of the Cauchy integral in \eqref{CI} is equivalent to the double-layer potential in \eqref{DLP:real}. 


\subsubsection{From Stokes DLP to Laplace DLPs}

Let ${\bf x}=(x_1,x_2), {\bf y}=(y_1,y_2)$. Then we have ${\bf r}={\bf x} - {\bf y}$ and $\rho=|\bf r|$.


The Stokes double-layer potential  is
\begin{equation}\label{StokesDLP1}
\D[\boldsymbol\sigma]({\bf x}):=\frac{1}{\pi}\int_{\Gamma}\left(\frac{{\bf r} \cdot {\bf n_y}}{\rho^2}\frac{{\bf r} \otimes {\bf r}}{\rho^2}\right) {\boldsymbol\sigma({\bf y})} d S_y.
\end{equation}
We could rewrite the Stokes DLP in terms of the Laplace DLP as
\begin{align*}\label{StokesDLP2}
\D[\boldsymbol\sigma]({\bf x})=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{\Gamma}&\frac{{\bf n_y}}{\rho^2}({\bf r} \cdot {\boldsymbol \sigma})dS_y+\frac{1}{2\pi}\nabla\int_{\Gamma}\frac{{\bf r} \cdot {\bf n_y}}{\rho^2}({\bf y} \cdot{\boldsymbol \sigma})dS_y\\
&-\frac{1}{2\pi}x_1 \nabla\int_{\Gamma}\frac{{\bf r} \cdot {\bf n_y}}{\rho^2}\sigma_1dS_y-\frac{1}{2\pi}x_2\nabla\int_{\Gamma}\frac{{\bf r} \cdot {\bf n_y}}{\rho^2}\sigma_2dS_y. \numberthis
\end{align*}


 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Computing the shear stress}
\label{sec:shearStressLP}

To calculate the shear stress, we need to know the gradient of double-layer potential in \eqref{StokesDLP2} 
\begin{align*}\label{SSLP}
\nabla\D[\boldsymbol\sigma]({\bf x})=\frac{1}{2\pi}\nabla\int_{\Gamma}&\frac{{\bf n_y}}{\rho^2}({\bf r} \cdot {\boldsymbol \sigma})dS_y+\frac{1}{2\pi}\nabla^2\int_{\Gamma}\frac{{\bf r} \cdot {\bf n_y}}{\rho^2}({\bf y} \cdot{\boldsymbol \sigma})dS_y\\
&-\frac{1}{2\pi}\nabla\left(x_1 \nabla\int_{\Gamma}\frac{{\bf r} \cdot {\bf n_y}}{\rho^2}\sigma_1dS_y\right)-\frac{1}{2\pi}\nabla\left(x_2\nabla\int_{\Gamma}\frac{{\bf r} \cdot {\bf n_y}}{\rho^2}\sigma_2dS_y\right). \numberthis
\end{align*}

\subsubsection{Interior Case}
Consider a Cauchy integral 
\begin{equation}\label{NCI}
v({x})=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{\Gamma}\frac{v^-({ y})}{{ y}-{ x}} d{ y},\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, \forall { x} \in \Cdb\setminus \Gamma.
\end{equation}
By the identity of Cauchy Integral Formula $\displaystyle\frac{1}{2 \pi i}\int_{\Gamma}\frac{1}{{ y}-{ x}} d{ y}=1,$ we can rewrtie \eqref{NCI} and get 
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{\Gamma}\frac{v^-({ y})-v(x)}{{ y}-{ x}} d{ y}=0,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, \forall { x} \in \Cdb\setminus \Gamma.
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{dNCI}
v'({x})=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{\Gamma}\frac{v^-({ y})}{(y- x)^2} d{ y},\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, \forall { x} \in \Cdb\setminus \Gamma.
\end{equation}
By the identity of Cauchy Integral Formula $\displaystyle\frac{1}{2 \pi i}\int_{\Gamma}\frac{1}{( y- x)^n} d{ y}=0$ for integer n $\neq 1$, we can rewrtie \eqref{dNCI} and get 
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{\Gamma}\frac{v^-({ y})-v(x)-(y-x)v'(x)}{(y-x)^2} d{ y}=0,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, \forall { x} \in \Cdb\setminus \Gamma.
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Exterior case}

\subsection{Shear stress}

\subsubsection{Interior Case}
\begin{equation}\label{ddNCI}
v''({x})=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{\Gamma}\frac{2v^-({ y})}{(y- x)^3} d{ y},\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, \forall { x} \in \Cdb\setminus \Gamma.
\end{equation}
By the identity of Cauchy Integral Formula $\displaystyle\frac{1}{2 \pi i}\int_{\Gamma}\frac{1}{( y- x)^n} d{ y}=0$ for integer n $\neq 1$, we can rewrtie \eqref{ddNCI} and get 
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{\Gamma}\frac{2v^-({ y})-2v(x)-2(y-x)v'(x)-(y-x)^2v''(x)}{(y-x)^3} d{ y}=0,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, \forall { x} \in \Cdb\setminus \Gamma.
