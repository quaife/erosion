\section{Formulation\label{s:formulation}} 
Let us first define the main variables used to model erosion.  We only
consider flows that are confined by a solid wall $\Gamma$ that encloses
$M$ eroding bodies.  The bodies are denoted as $\gamma_k$,
$k=1,\ldots,M$, and we write $\gamma = \gamma_1 \cup \cdots \cup
\gamma_M$.  Neglecting inertial forces, the dynamics of the fluid is
fully characterized by the position of the bodies $\xx_k(s,t) \in
\gamma_k$, where $s$ is the arclength and $t$ is time.  Given
$\xx_k(s,t)$, $k=1,\ldots,M$, derived variables include the fluid
velocity $\uu$, the pressure $p$, and the shear stress $\tau$.   On the
bounding wall, we prescribed a velocity $\UU(\xx,t)$.  Then, the
governing equations are
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:erosionModel}
\begin{split}
  \mu \Delta \uu = \grad p, &\hspace{20pt} \xx \in \Omega, \gap &&\mbox{conservation
of momentum}\\
\grad \cdot \uu = 0, &\hspace{20pt} \xx \in \Omega, \gap
&&\mbox{conservation of mass} \\
\uu = 0, &\hspace{20pt} \xx \in \gamma, \gap &&\mbox{no slip on the
bodies} \\
\uu = \UU, &\hspace{20pt} \xx \in \Gamma, \gap &&\mbox{outer wall
velocity} \\
\dot{\xx}(t) = -|\tau| \nn, &\hspace{20pt} \xx \in \gamma,
&&\mbox{erosion model},
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $\nn$ is the outward unit normal vector which points away from the
fluid.  The outer wall is formed by rounding off the corners of $[-3,3]
\times [-1,1]$, and we enforce the Hagen-Poiseuille flow
\begin{align*}
  \uu(\xx) = (1-y^2,0)
\end{align*}
on $\Gamma$.  The boundary of the fluid domain is $\bd\Omega = \gamma_1
\cup \cdots \cup \gamma_M \cup \Gamma$.  To minimize the boundary
effects of the inflow and outflow, we only place bodies in the center
third, $[-1,1] \times [-1,1]$, of the fluid domain.
\begin{figure}[htpb]
  \centering
  \input{figs/schematic.tikz}
  \caption{\label{fig:schematic} A schematic for the governing
    equations.  A no-slip boundary condition is imposed on each body
    $\gamma_k$ whose unit normal points outward relative to the
    geometry.  On the outer geometry $\Gamma$, a pipe flow is imposed.
    The bodies are eroded according to the shear stress applied by the
    Stokesian fluid.  Finally, the bodies are constrained to the middle
    third of the channel that is located between the dashed lines.}
\end{figure}

We use a quasi-static approximation.  That is, at each time step, we
freeze the geometry, solve the incompressible Stokes equations, and then
update the geometry according to the erosion model.  A flow diagram is
illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:workflow}.  The two steps inside the red
rectangle describes a time step in the quasi-static approximation
\begin{figure}[htpb]

  \caption{\label{fig:workflow}A caption.}
\end{figure}

Our erosion model is based on the shear stress, and this model is
discussed in more detail in Section~\ref{sec:erosion}.  We then describe
how the incompressible Stokes equations are solved in $\Omega$ using a
boundary integral equation in Section~\ref{sec:bies}.  Then, in
Section~\ref{sec:qois}, we discuss how the shear stress, pressure, and
drag can all be readily computed.  


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Erosion Model} 
\label{sec:erosion}

To model erosion, we the normal velocity is prescribed to be
proportional to the absolute value of the shear stress.  The constant of
proportionality sets the time scale, and we set its value to be -1
\begin{align}
  \dot{\xx}(t) = -|\tau| \nn.
  \label{eqn:bodyEvolution}
\end{align}

\todo[inline]{Describe the erosion model and its justification}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Boundary Integral Equation Formulation} 
\label{sec:bies}
Here we focus on solving the incompressible Stokes equations with
Dirichlet boundary conditions
\begin{alignat*}{3}
  \mu\Delta \uu &= \grad p, \qquad && \xx \in \Omega, \\
  \grad \cdot \uu &= 0,   && \xx \in \Omega, \\
  \uu &= \ff,  && \xx \in \bd\Omega.
\end{alignat*}
The viscosity $\mu$ sets the time scale, and we will assume that
$\mu=1$.  We start by defining the double-layer potential, which is the
convolution of the stresslet with a function $\eeta:\bd\Omega
\rightarrow \RR^2$,
\begin{align}
  \DD[\eeta](\xx) = \frac{1}{\pi} \int_{\bd\Omega} 
    \frac{\rr \cdot \nn}{\rho^2} \frac{\rr \otimes \rr}{\rho^2} 
    \eeta(\yy) \, ds_\yy, \quad \xx \in \Omega,
    \label{eqn:velocityDLP}
\end{align}
where $\rr = \xx - \yy$, $\rho = \|\rr\|$, and $\nn$ is the unit outward
normal at $\yy$.  For any density function $\eeta$, the double-layer
potential satisfies the incompressible Stokes equations, but the
double-layer potential can not capture velocity fields corresponding to
rigid body motions~\cite{pow-mir1987}.  A standard method to complete
the double-layer potential is to introduce a Stokeslet and rotlet
centered inside each interior body
\begin{align}
  S[\llambda_k,\cc_k] = \frac{1}{4\pi} \left(-\log \rho \II + 
    \frac{\rr \otimes \rr}{\rho^2} \right)\llambda_k
  \quad \text{and} \quad
  R[\xi_k,\cc_k] = \frac{\rr^\perp}{\rho^2}\xi_k,
  \label{eqn:stokeslet_rotlet}
\end{align}
where $\cc_k$ is a point inside the $k^{th}$ body,  $\rr = \xx - \cc_k$,
and $\rr^\perp = (r_2,-r_1)$.  Then, the solution of the Stokes
equations with a Dirichlet boundary condition $\ff$ is
\begin{align}
  \label{eqn:completed_DLP}
  \uu(\xx) = \DD[\eeta](\xx) + \sum_{k=1}^{M} S[\llambda_k,\cc_k](\xx) +
              \sum_{k=1}^{M} R[\xi_k,\cc_k](\xx), \quad \xx \in \Omega,
\end{align}
where the density function, Stokeslets, and rotlets satisfy
\begin{subequations}
\label{eqn:completed_BIE}
\begin{align}
  \ff(\xx) &= -\frac{1}{2}\eeta(\xx) + \DD[\eeta](\xx) + 
      \sum_{k=1}^{M} S[\llambda_k,\cc_k](\xx) +
      \sum_{k=1}^{M} R[\xi_k,\cc_k](\xx), \quad \xx \in \Gamma, 
      \label{eqn:DLP}\\
  \llambda_k &= \frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{\gamma_k} \eeta(\yy) \, ds_\yy, 
  \label{eqn:stokeslet} \\
  \xi_k &= \frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{\gamma_k} \yy^\perp \cdot \eeta(\yy)
  \, ds_\yy.
  \label{eqn:rotlet}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
Finally, because of the incompressibility constraint, the boundary
condition must satisfy 
\begin{align*}
  \int_{\bd\Omega} \ff \cdot \nn \, ds_\yy = 0.
\end{align*}
The result is a rank-one null space of~\eqref{eqn:completed_BIE} which
is removed by adding the rank-one modification 
\begin{align}
  \NN_0[\eeta](\xx) = \int_{\Gamma} 
    (\nn(\xx) \otimes \nn(\yy))\nn(\yy) \, ds_\yy, \quad \xx \in \Gamma.
\end{align}

\subsection{Computing the Shear Stress, Pressure, and Drag} 
\label{sec:qois}
There are several quantities besides the velocity that need to be
comnputed.  First, the governing equations~\eqref{eqn:erosionModel}
require the shear stress along $\gamma_k$.  In addition, to study
characteristics of the flow, the pressure and drag must also be
computed.  Once equation~\eqref{eqn:completed_DLP} is solved for the
density function, Stokeslets, and rotlets, all of these quantities can
be computed by evaluating layer potentials that we now derive.

\subsubsection{Shear Stress}
\todo[inline]{check all signs in this section.  Fortran code assumes an
inward pointing normal}
The shear stress is defined by
\begin{align}
  \tau = \left(\nabla \uu + \nabla \uu^T \right)\nn \cdot \ss,
  \label{eqn:shearStress}
\end{align}
where $\ss$ is the unit tangent vector (Figure~\ref{fig:schematic}).  We
note that for the Stokes equations, because of the no-slip boundary
condition on the bodies, the shear stress is identical to the surface
vorticity $\tau = u_y - v_x$.  However, we use
equation~\eqref{eqn:shearStress} to compute the shear stress since the
jump conditions resulting from the double-layer potential are
known~\cite{qua-bir2014a}.  The velocity field of the completed
double-layer potential~\eqref{eqn:completed_DLP} involves three terms:
the double-layer potential $\DD$, the Stokeslets $S$, and the rotlets
$R$.  To compute the shear stress, we first compute the deformation
tensor $\ssigma = \frac{1}{2}(\nabla\uu + \nabla\uu^T)$ of each of these
terms individually.

The deformation tensor of the double-layer
potential~\eqref{eqn:velocityDLP} at $\xx \in \Omega$ is
\begin{equation}
  \label{eqn:shearStressDLP}
  \begin{aligned}
  \ssigma^\DD(\xx) = \frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{\bd\Omega} &\left(
    2\frac{\rr \cdot \nn}{\rho^2} \frac{\rr \cdot \eeta}{\rho^2} \II + 
    \frac{\rr \cdot \eeta}{\rho^4} (\nn \otimes \rr + \rr \otimes \nn) 
    \right. \\
    &\left.
    +\frac{\rr \cdot \nn}{\rho^4} (\eeta \otimes \rr + \rr \otimes \eeta) - 
    8\frac{(\rr \cdot \nn)(\rr \cdot \eeta)}{\rho^6}(\rr \otimes \rr)
  \right) ds_\yy.
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
We are interested in the deformation tensor at boundary points $\xx_0
\in \bd\Omega$, and this requires an expression for the jump in
$\ssigma^\DD(\xx)$ as $\xx \rightarrow \xx_0 \in \Gamma$.  The limiting
value is given by~\cite{qua-bir2014a}
\begin{align*}
  \lim_{\substack{\xx \rightarrow \xx_0 \\ \xx \in \Omega}}\sigma_\DD(\xx) =
  J[\eeta](\xx_0) + \ssigma^\DD(\xx_0) = 
  \frac{1}{2}\pderiv{\eeta}{\ss} \cdot \ss
  \left[ \begin{array}{cc}
    s_x^2 - s_y^2 & 2s_x s_y \\ 2s_x s_y & s_y^2 - s_x^2
  \end{array}\right] + \ssigma^\DD(\xx_0), \quad \xx_0 \in \Gamma.
\end{align*}

The deformation tensor due to the Stokeslets and
rotlets~\eqref{eqn:stokeslet_rotlet} are
\begin{align*}
  \ssigma^S(\xx_0) &= \frac{\rr \cdot \llambda}{4\pi\rho^2} \left(
    \II - \frac{2}{\rho^2} \rr \otimes \rr \right),  \\
  \ssigma^R(\xx_0) &= -\frac{\xi}{\rho^4} \left(\rr \otimes \rr^\perp + 
                           \rr^\perp \otimes \rr \right).
\end{align*}
Now that the deformation tensor of each component of the completed
double-layer potential are computed, the shear stress at $\xx_0 \in
\Gamma$ can be written as
\begin{align*}
  \tau = \left(J[\eeta](\xx_0) + \ssigma^\DD(\xx_0) + 
    \ssigma^S(\xx_0) + \ssigma^R(\xx_0)\right) \nn \cdot \ss.
\end{align*}

\subsubsection{Pressure}
\todo[inline]{check all signs in this section.  Fortran code assumes an
inward pointing normal}
To compute the pressure at $\xx_0 \in \Gamma$, we follow the same
procedure used for the shear stress.  In particular, we compute the
pressure due to each of the three terms in the completed double-layer
potential~\eqref{eqn:completed_DLP}.  They are given by
\begin{align*}
  \lim_{\substack{\xx \rightarrow \xx_0 \\ \xx \in \Omega}}p^\DD(\xx) =  
  -\pderiv{\eeta}{\ss} \cdot \ss + p^{\DD}(\xx_0),
\end{align*}
where
\begin{align*}
  p^\DD(\xx) = -\frac{1}{\pi}\int_{\Gamma} \frac{1}{\rho^2}
    \left(I - 2 \frac{\rr \otimes \rr}{\rho^2}\right) 
    \nn \cdot \eeta(\yy) \,ds_\yy.
\end{align*}
The pressure due to the Stokeslets is
\begin{align}
  p^S(\xx_0) = \frac{\rr \cdot \llambda}{2\pi\rho^2},
  \label{eqn:pressureDLP}
\end{align}
and the pressure of a rotlet is zero.  Therefore, once the density
function and Stokeslets are computed, the pressure at a point $\xx_0 \in
\Gamma$ is
\begin{align*}
  p(\xx_0) = -\pderiv{\eeta}{\ss} \cdot \ss + p^{\DD}(\xx_0) + 
              \frac{\rr \cdot \llambda}{2\pi\rho^2}.
\end{align*}

\subsubsection{Drag}
\todo[inline]{check all signs in this section.  Fortran code assumes an
inward pointing normal}
Finally, with the pressure and shear stress, the drag on a single body
with boundary $\Gamma_k$ is
\begin{align*}
  F_D = \int_{\Gamma_k} (-p \nn + \tau \ss)\,ds.
\end{align*}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Numerical Methods\label{s:method}} 
We discretize the second-kind integral equation~\eqref{eqn:DLP} using a
Nystr\"om method.  The equations for the
Stokeslets~\eqref{eqn:stokeslet} and rotlets~\eqref{eqn:rotlet} are
approximated with the trapezoid rule.  By applying a quadrature method,
this results in a dense linear system which we solve with fast multipole
accelerated GMRES.  Because of the second-kind nature of the integral
equation, the number of GMRES iterations is mesh independent (but not
geometry independent), and the overall complexity of the Stokes solver
is proportional to the cost of a single matrix-vector multiplication.
The shear stress, pressure, and drag must also be computed using
quadrature, and this can be interpreted as a post-processing step once
the density function, Stokeslets, and rotlets are computed.  All the
quadrature methods are described in Section~\ref{sec:quadrature}

Once the shear stress is computed, it is used to update the shape of the
bodies according to the normal flow~\eqref{eqn:bodyEvolution}.  To
eliminate tangling and stretching of the mesh, we use a \thL
formulation~\cite{hou-low-she1994} which is described in
Section~\ref{sec:thetaL}.  In this section, we also describe our time
stepping method and two regularization terms that are necessary to
control the curvature of the bodies and to maintain spectral accuracy in
space.

\todo[inline]{Describe the upcoming subsections better}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Quadrature} 
\label{sec:quadrature}
There are several integrals that we need to compute including the
double-layer potential velocity field~\eqref{eqn:velocityDLP}, the shear
stress~\eqref{eqn:shearStressDLP}, and the
pressure~\eqref{eqn:pressureDLP}.  By using carefully choosing the
quadrature rules, high-order solutions can be computed.  For all the
integrals, the trapezoid rule is used since it achieves spectral
accuracy for smooth periodic functions.  However, care must be taken
when the source point and target points coincide.

For the velocity field, the kernel of the integral operator
\begin{align*}
  D(\xx,\yy) = \frac{\rr \cdot \nn}{\rho^2} 
               \frac{\rr \otimes \rr}{\rho^2}
\end{align*}
has a removable singularity when $\xx = \yy$.  In particular
\begin{align*}
  \lim_{\substack{\yy \rightarrow \xx \\ \yy \in \Gamma}} D(\xx,\yy) = 
  -\frac{\kappa(\xx)}{2\pi}\ss \otimes \ss,
\end{align*}
where $\kappa(\xx)$ is the curvature of $\Gamma$ at $\xx$.  By using
this limiting term in when applying the trapezoid rule, spectral
accuracy is achieved because of the smoothness and periodicity of the
integrand~\cite{tre-wei2014}.

For the shear stress and the pressure, we will use odd-even integration
which achieves spectral accuracy if the integrand is no stronger than
$\mathcal{O}(\rho^{-1})$.  Since both these integrands are too strong,
the singularity must be weakened.  This can be done by adding a constant
density function which has no effect on the shear stress and
pressure~\cite{poz1992}.  In particular, the shear stress due to the
double-layer potential is equivalent to
\begin{align*}
  \ssigma^{\DD}(\xx_0) &= \int_{\bd\Omega}K_\ssigma(\xx_0,\yy)
      \ssigma(\yy) \, ds_{\yy} \\ 
      &= \int_{\bd\Omega}K_\ssigma(\xx_0,\yy)
      (\ssigma(\yy) - \ssigma(\xx_0)) \, ds_{\yy}.
\end{align*}
For the pressure, the double-layer potential is equivalent to
\begin{align*}
  p^\DD(\xx) = -\frac{1}{\pi}\int_{\Gamma} \frac{1}{\rho^2}
    \left(I - 2 \frac{\rr \otimes \rr}{\rho^2}\right) 
    \nn \cdot (\eeta(\yy) - \eeta(\xx_0)) \,ds_\yy.
\end{align*}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Fast Summation} 
The majority of the computational cost comes from evaluating the the
double-layer potential $\mathcal{D}$ in equation~\eqref{eqn:DLP}.  This
layer potential can be efficiently evaluated using a fast summation
method such as the Fast Multipole Method
(FMM)~\cite{gre-rok1987}\footnote{The FMM for the Stokes double-layer
poetntial was supplied by Manas Rachh.}.  By using the
FMM,~\eqref{eqn:completed_BIE} can be solved with $\mathcal{O}(N)$
operations, where $N$ is the total number of discretization points.

In our erosion model, the shear stress must be computed which requires
evaulating the layer potential~\eqref{eqn:shearStressDLP}.  In our
implementation, this calculation is done directly which requires
$\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ operations.  This complexity could be reduced with
the kernel-independent FMM~\cite{yin-bir-zor2004}.  However, since this
calculation is only computed once per time step, unlike the velocity
double-layer potential that must be evaluated at each GMRES iteration.  

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{\thL Formulation} 
\label{sec:thetaL}

We use a quasi-static approximation so that the velocity field
instantaneously changes with the changing geometry.  Therefore, we can
alternate between the two main aspects of our simulation
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Given a geometry, compute the shear stress of along the boundary
    of each of the bodies.
  \item Given the shear stress, update the geometry according to the
    erosion model.
\end{enumerate}

\vsp{2}
To handle boundary evolution, we use the \thL    method, which offers certain advantages in the ability to stabilize fluid-structure interaction problems. Throughout this section, we use the following conventions: the bodies are parametrized in the CCW direction and the normal vector points into the bodies (our out of the fluid).

\todo[inline]{BRYAN: Can we use these conventions throughout the paper?}


In order to regularize boundary evolution, we modify
Eq.~(\ref{eqn:bodyEvolution}) to include a curvature-driven component
(also corrected errors in this equation)
\begin{equation}
\pderiv{\xx}{t} = |\tau| \nn + \eps \elfun(L) \left(\kappa - \frac{2 \pi}{L} \right)
\end{equation}
The curvature term acts to smooth bodies that have high-frequency oscillations.
