\section{Introduction\label{s:intro}}
Erosion is one example of a fluid-mechanical process that occurs when a
fluid alters the geometry.  Erosion is responsible for a variety of
processes, many of which are geophysical.  For example, sand dunes are
longer on the windward side because of the wind erosion.  Another
applications is erosion caused by groundwater flow, where a slow moving
fluid erodes channels, or conduits, in the earth which creates a
heterogeneous media that has a large effect on the resulting flow.
Erosion is also important in the biophysical community. Plaque erosion
in arteries is key to understanding heart disease~\cite{sha2002,
gro-gij-van-fer-hat-van-yua-wen2007}, and the separation of biofilms can
be explained by erosion~\cite{pic-van-hei2000}. In all these examples,
there is a feedback process between the flow and the erodible
bodies---the shape of the eroding body affects the flow, while the flow
changes the shape by fluidizing the eroding body.  This fluid-mechanical
feedback system has been simulated in idealized cases such as a single
eroding two-dimensional body in a uniform
flow~\cite{moo-ris-chi-zha-she2013} or a single mobile eroding
three-dimensional body~\cite{mit-spa2016}. To further develop insight
into the effect of two-dimensional erosion, we consider erosion of a
multiply-connected domain (Figure~\ref{fig:50bodies}), such as a porous
media that is typically used to model groundwater flow.

Because of the scales involved with groundwater flow, we will restrict
our attention to Stokesian dynamics.  For groundwater flow, Darcy's
equation are often used, but this assumes a homogeneous geometry which
is not always a fair assumption.  Instead, we will use the
incompressible Stokes equations to represent the flow, and the
individual pores will be be resolved, resulting in a complex
multiply-connected geometry.  A boundary integral equation is
well-suited as it can resolve complex geometries and the non-negligible
interactions between bodies are resolved, all the while high-order
accuracy and computational efficiency are achieved. To link the body and
fluid dynamics, the body is eroded in the normal direction at a rate
that is proportional to the magnitude of the shear
stress~\cite{ris-moo-chi-she-zha2012}. Other models for erosion include
ones that use an erosion rate that is proportional to a power of the
magnitude of the shear stress~\cite{par-izu2000}, or ones that use a
critical shear stress below which erosion does not occur~\cite{lag2000}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\paragraph{Contributions} The present study will develop numerical
methods to simulate viscous erosion of multiply-connected
two-dimensional geometries.  By assuming the flow is viscous, we are
assuming the flow is very slow and in small length scales, as is the
case in groundwater flow.  Moreover, by allowing for complex
multiply-connected domains, the effects due to interacting bodies on the
erosion are captured.  We start by authenticating our method on a single
circular body placed symmetrically in a pipe flow.  By artificially
fixing the area of the body as a function of time, we are able to
characterize the long-time behavior of the shape and the resulting flow
and compare these results with analytical results.  Then, we compute the
vorticity of erosion in multiply-connected geometries to better
characterize erosion in porous media. 

Because of the low Reynolds number assumption, the flow will be assumed
to be Stokesian.  Then, to create high-fidelity and computationally
efficient numerical methods, two fast and accurate methods will be
employed:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The fluid equations will be solved with spectral accuracy by
  using an efficient boundary integral equation method. Moreover, the
  rate of erosion will be computed and the rate of erosion will be
  computed with spectral accuracy.
  \item Given a rate of erosion, the shape will be integrated in time
  with second-order accuracy.  All spatial derivatives will be computed
  in Fourier space, resulting in spectral accuracy in space.
\end{enumerate}
We use a quasi-steady assumption so that these two steps can be iterated
to simulate the dynamics.

The effect of erosion on a geometry is quite rich.  For instance, it has
been hypothesized and numerically observed that the erosion leads to a
shear stress that is uniform on the body which results in a uniform
erosion rate.  The shape that has a uniform shear stress is analyzed in
three dimensions by Montenegro-Johnson and Lauga~\cite{mon-lau2015}
which is an extension of the analysis done by Pironneau~\cite{pir1973}
to find a Stokesian drag minimizing shape.  However, the effect of
erosion on a porous media is less understood.  With the methods
developed in this paper, quantities such as the total drag across a
porous region as a function of time can be computed in future work.

A challenge with erosion is that it creates corners at points on the
body where the shear stress vanishes.  While recent work does allow for
integral equation methods to resolve a corner, we employ a different
method.  First, we add a regularization term to the shear stress to
penalize regions of high curvature.  Second, we apply a Gaussian filter
to smooth the absolute value of the shear stress before the body shape
is updated.

To further visualize the effect of erosion, we compute the vorticity of
the flow (Figure~\ref{fig:50bodies}) which is equal to the shear stress
in the Stokesian limit.  Finally, to evolve the geometry, a second-order
time stepping method that guarantees that the mesh does not become
distorted will be employed.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\paragraph{Limitations} There are two main limitations of the current
work.  First, the flow is assumed to be two-dimensional.  However, by
assuming that the flow is two-dimensional, we are able to simulate the
erosion of more bodies and with higher resolution than would be
available in three dimensions.  Moreover, Several flows can be described
to good accuracy under a two-dimensional approximation, certain
phenomena occur only in three dimensions.  The boundary integral
equation formulation for the fluid solver exists, and the main
challenges of a BIE solver have been addressed by other groups including
surface representation~\cite{yin-bir-zor2006, vee-rah-bir-zor2011},
near-singular integration~\cite{yin-bir-zor2006, kli-tor2016b}, and fast
summation methods~\cite{yin-bir-zor2004, ros-ols2015}.  The more
significant challenge of extending our work to three dimensions is
guaranteeing that the mesh does not become distorted, which can be done,
for example, by using an extension of the two-dimensional {\thL}
formulation~\cite{amb-sie-tlu2013}.

The second limitation is that the eroding bodies are fixed.  Mitchell
and Spagnolie~\cite{mit-spa2016} simulate a single mobile eroding body
in three dimensions have been considered~\cite{mit-spa2016}, but
additional challenges are caused when there are multiple bodies. In
particular, especially in dense suspensions, bodies can become extremely
close to one another, and the interaction between the bodies is
difficult to resolve unless the underlying mesh is refined to levels
that are intractable. In future work we plan to consider mobile eroding
bodies, but include a small force and torque so that unphysical contact
is avoided~\cite{lu-rah-zor2017}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\paragraph{Related work} Simulating eroding bodies has been studied
analytically, experimentally, and numerically.  Because of the scales
involves with geophysical flows, most of these works consider high
Reynolds number flows.  For instance, the experimental work of Moore et
al.~\cite{moo-ris-chi-zha-she2013} considers on the order of $10^4$.
For low Reynolds number flows, Mitchell and Spagnolie~\cite{mit-spa2016}
simulate the erosion of a mobile body in three dimensions, but they only
consider single body.  

To simulate multiple bodies, it is essential to resolve the nonlocal
effects between the different bodies.  In this work, these interactions
are included with high-order accuracy by using an integral equation
method.  Integral equations have been used extensively to simulate
viscous fluids in complex geometries.  One particular application are
particulate flows, such as bubbles or droplets, and the classic book of
Pozrikidis~\cite{poz1992} describes boundary integral formulations for
such problems.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\paragraph{Outline of the paper} In Section~\ref{s:formulation}, we
describe the governing equations for both the fluid and describe the
erosion model using a \thL~framework.  In Section~\ref{s:method}, the
numerical methods in both space and time are described.
Section~\ref{s:results} gives several numerical examples.  Finally,
concluding remarks are made in Section~\ref{s:conclusions}

\section{Formulation}
\label{s:formulation}
We start by defining the main variables used to model erosion.  We only
consider flows that are confined by a solid wall $\Gamma$ that encloses
$M$ eroding bodies.  The bodies are denoted as $\gamma_\ell$,
$\ell=1,\ldots,M$, and we write $\gamma = \gamma_1 \cup \cdots \cup
\gamma_M$.  Neglecting inertial forces, the dynamics of the fluid is
fully characterized by the position of the bodies $\xx_\ell(s,t) \in
\gamma_\ell$, where $s$ is the arclength and $t$ is time.  Given
$\xx_\ell(s,t)$, $\ell=1,\ldots,M$, derived variables include the fluid
velocity $\uu$, the pressure $p$, and the shear stress $\tau$.   On the
bounding wall, we prescribed a velocity $\UU(\xx,t)$.  Then, the
governing equations are
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:erosionModel}
\begin{split}
  \mu \Delta \uu = \grad p, &\hspace{20pt} \xx \in \Omega, \gap &&\mbox{conservation
of momentum}\\
\grad \cdot \uu = 0, &\hspace{20pt} \xx \in \Omega, \gap
&&\mbox{conservation of mass} \\
\uu = 0, &\hspace{20pt} \xx \in \gamma, \gap &&\mbox{no slip on the
bodies} \\
\uu = \UU, &\hspace{20pt} \xx \in \Gamma, \gap &&\mbox{outer wall
velocity} \\
\Vn = \abs{\tau}, &\hspace{20pt} \xx \in \gamma,
&&\mbox{erosion model},
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $\Vn$ is the normal velocity of the interface and $\mu$ is the
fluid viscosity.  The outer wall is formed by rounding off the corners
of $[-3,3] \times [-1,1]$, and we enforce the Hagen-Poiseuille flow
\begin{align*}
  \UU(\xx) = \umax (1-y^2,0)
\end{align*}
on $\Gamma$.  Here, $U$ sets the maximum of the imposed Poiseuille flow. Often, we will simply set $U=1$, but in some instances we will change $U$ dynamically to enforce that the pressure drop across the computational cell is constant as bodies erode within it.
The boundary of the fluid domain is $\bd\Omega = \gamma_1
\cup \cdots \cup \gamma_M \cup \Gamma$.  To minimize the boundary
effects of the inflow and outflow, we only place bodies in the center
third, $[-1,1] \times [-1,1]$, of the fluid domain.
\begin{figure}[htpb]
  \centering
  \input{figs/schematic.tikz}
  \caption{\label{fig:schematic} A schematic for the governing
    equations.  A no-slip boundary condition is imposed on each body
    $\gamma_\ell$ whose unit normal points outward relative to the
    geometry.  On the outer geometry $\Gamma$, a pipe flow is imposed.
    The bodies are eroded at a rate that is proportional to the
    magnitude of the shear stress applied by the Stokesian fluid.  The
    bodies are constrained to the middle third of the channel that is
    located between the dashed lines.}
\end{figure}

We use a quasi-static approximation.  That is, at each time step, we
freeze the geometry, solve the incompressible Stokes equations, and then
update the geometry according to the erosion model.  A flow diagram is
illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:workflow}.  The two steps inside the red
rectangle describes a time step in the quasi-static approximation

\end{figure}

Our erosion model is based on the shear stress, and this model is
discussed in more detail in Section~\ref{sec:erosion}.  We then describe
how the incompressible Stokes equations are solved in $\Omega$ using a
boundary integral equation in Section~\ref{sec:bies}.  In
Section~\ref{sec:shearStressLP}, we discuss how the shear stress is
computed.  Finally, in Section~\ref{sec:thetaL}, we describe how corners
in the geometry are avoided and perform a change of coordinates that
linearizes a stiff term.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Erosion Model} 
\label{sec:erosion}

To model erosion, the normal velocity is prescribed to be
proportional to the absolute value of the shear stress.   Since the
constant of proportionality only sets the time scale, we let $\Vn =
|\tau|$ as described in equation~\eqref{eqn:erosionModel}.
\begin{align}
  \Vn = \abs{\tau} \nn.
  \label{eqn:bodyEvolution}
\end{align}
For the sake of numerical stability, we modify this law in
Section~\ref{sec:thetaL}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Boundary Integral Equation Formulation} 
\label{sec:bies}
Here we describe a boundary integral equation to solve the fluid
equations. In particular, we solve the incompressible Stokes equations
with Dirichlet boundary conditions 
\begin{alignat*}{3}
  \mu\Delta \uu &= \grad p, \qquad && \xx \in \Omega, \\
  \grad \cdot \uu &= 0,   && \xx \in \Omega, \\
  \uu &= \ff,  && \xx \in \bd\Omega.
\end{alignat*}
As the viscosity $\mu$ also sets the time scale, we take $\mu=1$.  We
start by defining the double-layer potential
$\eeta:\bd\Omega \rightarrow \RR^2$,
\begin{align}
  \DD[\eeta](\xx) = \frac{1}{\pi} \int_{\bd\Omega} 
    \frac{\rr \cdot \nn}{\rho^2} \frac{\rr \otimes \rr}{\rho^2} 
    \eeta(\yy) \, ds_\yy, \quad \xx \in \Omega,
    \label{eqn:velocityDLP}
\end{align}
where $\rr = \xx - \yy$, $\rho = \|\rr\|$, $\nn$ is the unit outward
normal at $\yy$, and $\eeta$ is an unknown density function.  The
double-layer potential can not capture velocity fields corresponding to
rigid body motions~\cite{pow-mir1987}, and this is rectified by
introducing additional terms for each body.  The rank deficiency removed
by complementing the double-layer potential with a Stokeslets and
rotlets centered inside each interior body
\begin{align}
  S[\llambda_\ell,\cc_\ell] = \frac{1}{4\pi} \left(-\log \rho \II + 
    \frac{\rr \otimes \rr}{\rho^2} \right)\llambda_\ell
  \quad \text{and} \quad
  R[\xi_\ell,\cc_\ell] = \frac{\rr^\perp}{\rho^2}\xi_\ell, 
  \quad \ell=1,\ldots,M,
  \label{eqn:stokeslet_rotlet}
\end{align}
where  $\rr = \xx - \cc_\ell$, $\cc_\ell$ is a point inside the
$\ell^{th}$ body, $\rr^\perp = (r_2,-r_1)$, and $\rho = \|\rr\|$.  Then,
any solution of the Stokes equations with a Dirichlet boundary condition
$\ff$ can be written in terms of the completed double-layer potential
\begin{align}
  \label{eqn:completed_DLP}
  \uu(\xx) = \DD[\eeta](\xx) + 
    \sum_{\ell=1}^{M} S[\llambda_\ell,\cc_\ell](\xx) +
    \sum_{\ell=1}^{M} R[\xi_\ell,\cc_\ell](\xx), \quad \xx \in \Omega,
\end{align}
where the density function, Stokeslets, and rotlets satisfy
\begin{subequations}
\label{eqn:completed_BIE}
\begin{align}
  \ff(\xx) &= -\frac{1}{2}\eeta(\xx) + \DD[\eeta](\xx) + 
      \sum_{\ell=1}^{M} S[\llambda_\ell,\cc_\ell](\xx) +
      \sum_{\ell=1}^{M} R[\xi_\ell,\cc_\ell](\xx) + \NN_0[\eeta](\xx),
      \quad \xx \in \bd\Omega, 
      \label{eqn:DLP}\\
  \llambda_\ell &= \frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{\gamma_\ell} \eeta(\yy) \, ds_\yy,
  \quad \ell=1,\ldots,M,
  \label{eqn:stokeslet} \\
  \xi_\ell &= \frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{\gamma_\ell} \yy^\perp \cdot \eeta(\yy)
  \, ds_\yy, \quad \ell=1,\ldots,M.
  \label{eqn:rotlet}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
Here,
\begin{align*}
  \NN_0[\eeta](\xx) = \int_{\Gamma} 
    (\nn(\xx) \otimes \nn(\yy))\eeta(\yy) \, ds_\yy
\end{align*}
removes the rank one null space that results from the compatibility
constraint that results from the flux-free requirement of $\ff$.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Computing the Shear Stress}
\label{sec:shearStressLP}
The shear stress is
\begin{align*}
  \tau = -\left(\nabla \uu + \nabla \uu^T \right)\nn \cdot \ss,
\end{align*}
where $\ss$ and $\nn$ are the unit tangent and normal vectors,
respectively (Figure~\ref{fig:schematic}).  The velocity field of the
completed double-layer potential~\eqref{eqn:completed_DLP} involves
three terms: the double-layer potential, the Stokeslets, and the
rotlets.  We compute the deformation tensor $\ssigma =
\frac{1}{2}(\nabla\uu + \nabla\uu^T)$ for each of these terms
individually.

The deformation tensor of the double-layer
potential~\eqref{eqn:velocityDLP} at $\xx \in \Omega$ is
\begin{equation}
  \label{eqn:shearStressDLP}
  \begin{aligned}
  \ssigma^\DD(\xx) = \frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{\bd\Omega} &\left(
    2\frac{\rr \cdot \nn}{\rho^2} \frac{\rr \cdot \eeta}{\rho^2} \II + 
    \frac{\rr \cdot \eeta}{\rho^4} (\nn \otimes \rr + \rr \otimes \nn) 
    \right. \\
    &\left.
    +\frac{\rr \cdot \nn}{\rho^4} (\eeta \otimes \rr + \rr \otimes \eeta) - 
    8\frac{(\rr \cdot \nn)(\rr \cdot \eeta)}{\rho^6}(\rr \otimes \rr)
  \right) \eeta(\yy) ds_\yy.
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
We require the deformation tensor on $\bd\Omega$, and this requires
taking the limit of equation~\eqref{eqn:shearStressDLP} when $\xx$ tends
to $\xx_0 \in \bd\Omega$.  The limiting value is given
by~\cite{qua-bir2014a}
\begin{align*}
  \lim_{\substack{\xx \rightarrow \xx_0 \\ \xx \in \Omega}}\sigma_\DD(\xx) =
  J[\eeta](\xx_0) + \ssigma^\DD(\xx_0), \quad \xx_0 \in \bd\Omega,
\end{align*} 
where
\begin{align}
  J[\eeta](\xx_0) = \frac{1}{2}\left(\pderiv{\eeta}{\ss} 
    \cdot \ss\right) \left[ 
  \begin{array}{cc}
    s_x^2 - s_y^2 & 2s_x s_y \\ 2s_x s_y & s_y^2 - s_x^2
  \end{array}\right].
  \label{eqn:shearStressJump}
\end{align}
The deformation tensor of the Stokeslets and
rotlets~\eqref{eqn:stokeslet_rotlet} are
\begin{equation}
  \label{eqn:shearStressSR}
  \begin{aligned}
  \ssigma^S(\xx_0) &= \sum_{\ell=1}^{M}
    \frac{\rr \cdot \llambda_\ell}{4\pi\rho^2} \left(
    \II - \frac{2}{\rho^2} \rr \otimes \rr \right),  \\
  \ssigma^R(\xx_0) &= -\sum_{\ell=1}^M
    \frac{\xi_\ell}{\rho^4} \left(\rr \otimes \rr^\perp + 
    \rr^\perp \otimes \rr \right),
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where $\rr = \xx - \cc_\ell$, $\cc_\ell$ is the point chosen inside body
$\gamma_\ell$, and $\rho = \|\rr_\ell\|$.  Now that the deformation
tensor of each component of the completed double-layer potential is
computed, the shear stress at $\xx_0 \in \bd\Omega$ is
\begin{align}
  \tau = -2 \left(J[\eeta](\xx_0) + \ssigma^\DD(\xx_0) + 
    \ssigma^S(\xx_0) + \ssigma^R(\xx_0)\right) \nn \cdot \ss.
  \label{eqn:shearStressLP}
\end{align}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Interface evolution in the {\thL} framework} 
\label{sec:thetaL}

To handle boundary evolution, we use the {\thL} framework, which offers
certain advantages in the ability to stabilize fluid-structure
interaction problems \cite{hou-low-she1994}. Throughout this section, we
use the following conventions: the bodies are parametrized in the CCW
direction and the normal vector points into the bodies (or out of the
fluid).

For the sake of numerical stability, we modify the erosion law in
equation~\eqref{eqn:bodyEvolution} to include a term that depends on the
local curvature $\kappa$. The idea is to prevent regions of very high
curvature. The modified normal velocity is 
\begin{align}
  \label{eqn:Vn}
  \Vn = \atau + \eps \mean{\atau} \left( \frac{L }{2\pi} \kappa - 1 \right)
\end{align}
Here, $\eps$ is a small parameter, $L$ is the total arc length of the
body, and $\mean{\cdot}$ indicates a boundary mean. The second term on
the right acts to smooth bodies with high-frequency oscillations by
introducing a {\em curvature}-dependent component in the interface
velocity. Since a closed body has a mean curvature of $\mean{\kappa} =
2\pi / L$, the term in parentheses has mean zero. Thus, this term is
area-preserving, so that the only material loss is due to the shear
stress itself. In addition, we have scaled this term on the
$\mean{\atau}$, the average absolute stress, so that it is always
proportional to the true source of erosion $\atau$, even as bodies
vanish. \todo[inline]{reword}

We now introduce the tangent angle, $\theta$, defined through the relation
\begin{align*}
\left( \pderiv{x}{s}, \pderiv{y}{s} \right) = \left(\cos \theta, \sin
\theta \right),
\end{align*}
where $s$ is arc length. We also introduce the normalized arc length $\alpha = 2 \pi s / L$. In terms of these new variables, the curvature can be expressed as
\begin{align*}
\kappa = \frac{2 \pi}{L} \pderiv{\theta}{\alpha}.
\end{align*}
Substitution into~\eqref{eqn:Vn} gives
\begin{align}
\label{eqn:Vn2}
\Vn = \atau +  \eps \mean{\atau}   \left(\pderiv{\theta}{\alpha} - 1 \right)
%\Vn = \atau + \frac{2 \pi \eps}{L \log \left(2\pi/L \right)}  \left(\pderiv{\theta}{\alpha} - 1 \right)
\end{align}

The main idea is to introduce an artificial tangential velocity that
keeps collocation points equally spaced with respect to arc length;
i.e.~the grid of $\alpha$ should always remain equally spaced. The
tangential velocity that does the trick satisfies~\cite{hou-low-she1994}
\begin{align*}
\pderiv{\Vs}{\alpha} = \thalpha \Vn - \mean{\thalpha \Vn}.
\end{align*}
The interface evolution is then given by
\begin{align*}
\dot{\xx}(t) = \Vn \nn + \Vs \ss.
\end{align*}
This evolution equation can be recast in the variables $\theta$ and $L$
as
\begin{align*}
\tderiv{L}{t} &= - 2 \pi \mean{\thalpha \Vn}, \\
\pderiv{\theta}{t} &= \frac{2 \pi}{L} \left( \pderiv{\Vn}{\alpha} +
\thalpha \Vs \right).
\end{align*}
Inserting~\eqref{eqn:Vn2} for the normal velocity gives
\begin{align}
\label{eqn:Levo1}
\tderiv{L}{t} &= - 2 \pi \mean{\thalpha \Vn}, \\
\label{eqn:thetaevo1}
\pderiv{\theta}{t} &= \frac{2\pi}{L} \left(
\eps \mean{\atau} \ppd{\theta}{\alpha} + \pderiv{\atau}{\alpha} + \thalpha \Vs \right)
\end{align}
Note that stiffest term in~\eqref{eqn:thetaevo1} involving the
second-order derivative is {\em quasi-linear}. This is the key to the
{\thL} method, and allows us to use very stable, implicit methods for
this stiff term that are described in Section~\ref{sec:timeStepping}. 


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Numerical Methods}
\label{s:method}
There are three main numerical methods that need to be developed.  In
Section~\ref{sec:BIE}, we describe how the BIE~\eqref{eqn:completed_BIE}
is solved.  Once the density function is found,
Section~\ref{sec:shearStress} describes how the shear
stress~\eqref{eqn:shearStressLP} is computed.  Then, in
Section~\ref{sec:timeStepping}, a time stepping method for evolving the
interface according to equations~\eqref{eqn:Levo1}
and~\eqref{eqn:thetaevo1} are described.

So that we can form stable simulations with long time horizons, we use
numerical methods that achieve spectral accuracy in space, second-order
accuracy in time, and maintain an equispaced discretization of the
bodies.  The boundaries are represented in Fourier space, and all
derivatives are computed with spectral accuracy using Fourier
differentiation.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Solving the BIE}
\label{sec:BIE}

To numerically evaluate the completed double-layer
potential~\eqref{eqn:completed_BIE}, we let $N_\iin$ be the number of
points on each of the $M$ bodies, and $N_\out$ be the number of points
on the outer boundary.  Then, $N = MN_\iin + N_\out$ is the total number
of discretization points of $\bd\Omega$.  The double-layer potential
in~\eqref{eqn:DLP} is discretized with the trapezoid rule as
\begin{align}
  \DD[\eeta](\xx_i) = \sum_{j=1}^{N} K(\xx_i,\xx_j) \eeta(\xx_j) 
      \Delta s_{j}, \quad i=1,\ldots,N,
  \label{eqn:trapDLP}
\end{align}
where $\Delta s_j$ is the arclength term of $\bd\Omega$ at
$\xx_j$, and
\begin{align*}
  K(\xx,\yy) = \frac{1}{\pi} \frac{\rr \cdot \nn}{\rho^2} 
      \frac{\rr \otimes \rr}{\rho^2},
\end{align*}
where $\rr = \xx - \yy$ and $\rho = \|\rr\|$, is the kernel of the
double-layer potential.  The diagonal term of~\eqref{eqn:trapDLP} is
replaced with the limiting value of the double-layer potential
\begin{align*}
  D(\xx,\xx) = -\frac{\kappa(\xx)}{2\pi}(\ss(\xx) \otimes \ss(\xx)),
\end{align*}
where $\kappa(\xx)$ is the curvature and $\ss(\xx)$ is the unit tangent
vector at $\xx \in \bd\Omega$.  The equations for the
Stokeslets~\eqref{eqn:stokeslet} and the rotlets~\eqref{eqn:rotlet} are
also discretized with the trapezoid rule.  Applying this discretization
strategy to~\eqref{eqn:completed_BIE}, the dense linear system that
needs to be solved is
\begin{equation}
  \label{eqn:completed_BIE_discretized}
  \begin{aligned}
    \ff(\xx_i) &= -\frac{1}{2}\ssigma(\xx_i) + \sum_{j=1}^{N} 
      K(\xx_i,\xx_j) \eeta(\xx_j) \Delta s_{j} + 
      \sum_{\ell=1}^M S[\llambda_\ell,\cc_\ell](\xx_i) \\
      &\hspace{40pt}
      +\sum_{\ell=1}^M R[\xi_\ell,\cc_\ell](\xx_i) 
      +\sum_{\xx_j \in \Gamma} (\nn(\xx_i) \otimes
      \nn(\xx_j))\eeta(\xx_j), \\
    \llambda_\ell &= \sum_{\xx_i \in \gamma_\ell} \eeta(\xx_i) 
      \Delta s_i, \\ 
    \mu_\ell &= \sum_{\xx_i \in \gamma_\ell}
      {(\xx_i - \cc_\ell)}^\perp \cdot \eeta(\xx_i) \Delta s_i,
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
for $i=1,\ldots,N$, $\ell=1,\ldots,M$.  Since all the integrands are
smooth and periodic, by using the trapezoid rule, we are guaranteed that
the numerical solutions converges to the true solution with spectral
accuracy.

The linear system~\eqref{eqn:completed_BIE_discretized} is solved
iteratively with the generalized minimal residual method
(GMRES)~\cite{saa-sch1986}.  Since the BIE is second-kind, only a
mesh-independent number of GMRES iterations are
required~\cite{cam-ips-kel-mey-xue1996}.  Therefore, the asymptotic cost
is determined by the cost of performing a matrix-vector multiplication,
and the bulk of the cost is evaluating the $N$-term sum
in~\eqref{eqn:completed_BIE_discretized}.  Naively, evaluating this sum
at all points $\xx_i$, $i=1,\ldots,N$ requires $\bigO(N^2)$ operations.
To reduce the computational cost, we use the Fast Multipole Method
(FMM)~\cite{gre-rok1987, gre-gre-may1992} to reduce the complexity from
$\bigO(N^2)$ to $\bigO(N)$.  Since the number of required GMRES
iterations is mesh-independent, the overall complexity for
solving~\eqref{eqn:completed_BIE_discretized} is $\bigO(N)$.

\subsection{Shear Stress}
\label{sec:shearStress}
We have decomposed the deformation tensor into the contributions due to
three different terms.  The contributions from the Stokeslets and the
rotlets can be directly evaluated since $\rr \neq 0$ for all $\xx \in
\gamma$.  However, the kernel of the deformation tensor due to the
double-layer potential~\eqref{eqn:shearStressDLP} 
\begin{align*}
  K_\ssigma(\xx,\yy)\eeta(\yy) &= \frac{1}{2\pi} \left(
    2\frac{\rr \cdot \nn}{\rho^2} \frac{\rr \cdot \eeta}{\rho^2} \II + 
    \frac{\rr \cdot \eeta}{\rho^4} (\nn \otimes \rr + \rr \otimes \nn)
    \right. \\ & \hspace{25pt}+ \left.
    \frac{\rr \cdot \nn}{\rho^4} (\eeta \otimes \rr + \rr \otimes \eeta) - 
    8\frac{(\rr \cdot \nn)(\rr \cdot \eeta)}{\rho^6}(\rr \otimes \rr)
  \right),
\end{align*}
has a singularity that is asymptotic to $\bigO(\rho^{-2})$ when $\yy
\rightarrow \xx$.  The singularity strength can be reduced since the
velocity corresponding to a constant density function is
constant~\cite{poz1992}.  Therefore, the deformation tensor of the
double-layer potential is equivalent to
\begin{align*}
  \ssigma^{\DD}(\xx) = \int_{\bd\Omega}K_\ssigma(\xx,\yy)
      (\eeta(\yy) - \eeta(\xx)) \, ds_{\yy}, \quad \xx \in \bd\Omega.
\end{align*}
This expression for the deformation tensor has a singularity that is
asymptotic to $\bigO(\rho^{-1})$ when $\yy \rightarrow \xx$.  Finally,
to achieve spectral accuracy, we apply odd-even
integration~\cite{sid-isr1988}.  Therefore, the deformation tensor of
the double-layer potential at a discretization point $\xx_i$ on body
$\gamma_\ell$, with $i$ being odd, is approximated as
\begin{align}
  \ssigma^{\DD}(\xx_i) = \sum_{\xx_j \notin \gamma_\ell}
    K_\ssigma(\xx_i,\xx_j) \eeta(\xx_j) \Delta s_j + 
  \sum_{\substack{\xx_j \in \gamma_\ell \\ j \: \mathtt{even}}}
    K_\ssigma(\xx_i,\xx_j) (\eeta(\xx_j) - \eeta(\xx_i)) \Delta s_j,
  \label{eqn:stressOddEven}
\end{align}
and a similar approximation is used when $i$ is even.  The deformation
tensor due to the Stokeslets and rotlets is given in
equation~\eqref{eqn:shearStressSR}.  Finally, the jump in the
deformation tensor~\eqref{eqn:shearStressJump} is computed with Fourier
differentiation.  Then, the shear stress is computed by multiplying the
deformation tensor by the normal vector, and taking the inner product
with the tangent vector.

We do not employ an FMM to evaluate the shear stress at $\xx_i$,
$i=1,\ldots,N$, so the cost of evaluating the shear stress is
$\bigO(N^2)$.  However, this calculation is only performed once per time
step as opposed to the velocity double-layer potential that must be
evaluated at each GMRES iteration.  In future work, we plan to use a
kernel-independent FMM~\cite{yin-bir-zor2004} to evaluate the shear
stress with $\bigO(N)$ operations.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% TIME-STEPPING %%
\subsection{Time-stepping with the {\thL} method} 
\label{sec:timeStepping}

With the shear stress computed, we are now ready to evolve the interface
of each body using equations~\eqref{eqn:Levo1}
and~\eqref{eqn:thetaevo1}. As described in Section~\ref{sec:thetaL}, we
use the {\thL} framework, with $\theta$ being the tangent angle and $L$
the total arc length of a given boundary, and with the boundaries
parameterized by normalized arc length $\alpha = 2 \pi s / L$.

In addition to the curvature-dependent term in~\eqref{eqn:Vn}, we
regularize boundary evolution by applying a narrow Gaussian filter to
absolute shear stress
\begin{align*}
\atausig = \int_{\gamma} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi} \sigma} \exp \left(-
\frac{\alpha'^2}{2 \sigma^2}\right) \abs{ \tau(\alpha - \alpha') } \,
d\alpha'.
\end{align*}
Here $\sigma$ is a small parameter that determines the width of the
filter. The corresponding normal and tangential interface velocities are
the given by
\begin{align*}
& \Vnsig = \atausig +  \eps \mean{\atausig}
\left(\pderiv{\theta}{\alpha} - 1 \right), \\
& \pderiv{\Vssig}{\alpha} = \thalpha \Vnsig - \mean{\thalpha \Vnsig}.
\end{align*}

For convenience, we introduce the variables
\begin{align*}
%\label{eq:M}
& \Mterm = - 2 \pi \mean{\thalpha \Vnsig}, \\
%\label{eq:N}
& \NLterm = \frac{2 \pi}{L} \left( \pderiv{\atausig}{\alpha} + \thalpha
\Vssig \right), \\
%\label{eq:elfun}
& \elfun = \frac{2 \pi  \mean{\atausig}}{L}.
\end{align*}
Then, the evolution equations~\eqref{eqn:Levo1}
and~\eqref{eqn:thetaevo1} can be compactly expressed as
\begin{align}
\label{eqn:Levo2}
& \tderiv{L}{t} = \Mterm, \\
\label{eqn:thetaevo2}
& \pderiv{\theta}{t} = \eps \elfun \ppd{\theta}{\alpha} + \NLterm.
\end{align}
Here $\NLterm$ represents the nonlinear terms (and nonlocal terms) in
the PDE for $\theta$.  

We can evolve $\theta$ in spectral space since $\theta(\alpha)$ is
periodic up to a jump of $2\pi$ for $\alpha \in [0,2\pi]$.  Therefore,
we introduce the Fourier series
\begin{align}
 \theta(\alpha,t) &= \alpha + \FourierSum \thhat_k e^{ i k \alpha}, \\
 \NLterm(\alpha,t)  &= \FourierSum \widehat{\NLterm}_k e^{ i k \alpha}.
\end{align}
The careful reader will notice that we have separated out the linear
part of $\theta$, so that the remaining function is smooth and has a
rapidly decaying Fourier series.  In spectral
space,~\eqref{eqn:thetaevo2} produces the system of ODEs
\begin{align*}
\tderiv{\thhat_k}{t} +  \eps k^2  \elfun \thhat_k = \widehat{\NLterm}_k.
\end{align*}
Each ODE is first-order and linear (though variable-coefficient due to
$\elfun$) and thus can be solved by using the integrating factor
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:mu}
  \mu_k = \exp \left( \eps k^2 \int \elfun \, dt \right).
\end{align}
We are therefore led to the coupled system of ODEs
\begin{align}
\label{eqn:Levo3}
& \tderiv{L}{t} = \Mterm, \\
\label{eqn:thetaevo3}
& \tderiv{}{t}\left( \mu_k \thhat_k \right) = \mu_k \widehat{\NLterm}_k.
\end{align}
We solve system~\eqref{eqn:Levo3}--\eqref{eqn:thetaevo3} with an
explicit, second-order Runge-Kutta method (RK2). In particular, we
choose the {\em midpoint} RK2 method so as to maximize the smoothing
effect of the curvature term.

At the first stage of RK2 (the half step), we discretize
equations~\eqref{eqn:Levo3}--\eqref{eqn:thetaevo3} as
\begin{align}
\label{eq:L12}
& \frac{L^{(n+1/2)} - L^{(n)}}{\Dt/2} = \Mterm^{(n)} \\
& \frac{ \mu_k^{(n+1/2)} \thhat_k^{(n+1/2)} - \thhat_k^{(n)}}{\Dt/2} = \hat{\NLterm}_k^{(n)}
\end{align}
where the superscript indicates the time step. For simplicity, we have
chosen the constant of integration in the exponent of
equation~\eqref{eq:mu} so that $\mu_k^{(n)} = 1$. At the next stage of
RK2, we must compute $\Mterm^{(n+1/2)}$ and
$\widehat{\NLterm}_k^{(n+1/2)}$, which requires a call to the Stokes
solver. Hence, we must compute $\mu_k^{(n+1/2)}$, so that
$\thhat_k^{(n+1/2)}$ can be recovered and the geometry at the mid-step
can be computed. To compute $\mu_k^{(n+1/2)}$, we use the left-end-point
rule (first order, consistent with first forward Euler step of RK2)
\begin{align*}
\mu_k^{(n+1/2)} = \exp \left( \epsilon k^2 \frac{\Dt}{2}
\elfun^{(n)}\right).
\end{align*}
It is instructive to recast as
\begin{align*}
\thhat_k^{(n+1/2)} = \left( \thhat_k^{(n)} + \frac{1}{2} \Dt \, \hat{\NLterm}_k^{(n)} \right)
\exp \left( -\epsilon k^2 \frac{\Dt}{2} \elfun^{(n)}\right)
\end{align*}
so that the smoothing effect of the exponential is obvious. With
$\thhat_k^{(n+1/2)}$ computed, it is now possible to compute
$\Mterm^{(n+1/2)}$ and $\widehat{\NLterm}_k^{(n+1/2)}$.

Next, at the second stage of RK2, we discretize as
\begin{align*}
\frac{L^{(n+1)} - L^{(n)}}{\Dt} &= \Mterm^{(n+1/2)}, \\
\frac{ \mu_k^{(n+1)} \thhat_k^{(n+1)} - \thhat_k^{(n)}}{\Dt} &=
\mu_k^{(n+1/2)} \hat{\NLterm}_k^{(n+1/2)}.
\end{align*}
We again compute the integrating factor, $\mu_k^{(n+1)}$ via the
\todo[inline]{insert integration rule}, giving
\begin{align*}
\thhat_k^{(n+1)} = 
& \thhat_k^{(n)}
\exp \left( - \epsilon k^2 \Dt \elfun^{(n+1/2)} \right) +  \\
& \Dt \, \hat{\NLterm}_k^{(n+1/2)}
\exp \left( - \frac{1}{4} \eps k^2 \Dt \left( 3 \elfun^{(n+1/2)} -
\elfun^{(n)} \right) \right).
\end{align*}

\section{Post Processing Quantities of Interest}
\label{s:qoi}
To study characteristics of the flow, the vorticity
(Section~\ref{sec:vorticity}), pressure (Section~\ref{sec:pressure}),
and drag (Section~\ref{sec:drag}) will be computed.  Once
equation~\eqref{eqn:completed_DLP} is solved for the density function,
Stokeslets, and rotlets, all of these quantities can be computed.  For
target points in the fluid domain, the resulting layer potentials
involve integrands that are periodic, so the trapezoid rule guarantees
spectral accuracy since the integrand is smooth~\cite{tre-wei2014}.
However, if the target point is close to a boundary, a nearly-singular
integrand must be integrated, and this requires upsampling that is
described in Section~\ref{sec:NSI}.  When the target points is on the
boundary, the integrands involve singularities that are evaluated by
combining singularity subtraction and odd-even
integration~\cite{sid-isr1988}.  



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Vorticity}
\label{sec:vorticity}
We start by computing the vorticity $w(\xx) = v_x - u_y$ for $\xx \in
\Omega$.  As we did for the shear stress, we compute the vorticity due
to the double-layer potential, Stokeslets, and rotlets individually.
The vorticity of the double-layer potential~\eqref{eqn:velocityDLP} at
$\xx \in \Omega$ is
\begin{align}
  w^{\DD}(\xx) = -\frac{1}{\pi}\int_{\bd\Omega} 
    \frac{(\rr \cdot \nn^\perp) + (\rr \cdot \nn)}{\rho^4}
    (\rr \cdot \eeta) ds_{\yy}.
  \label{eqn:vorticityDLP}
\end{align}
The vorticity due to the Stokeslet is
\begin{align*}
  w^S(\xx) = -\frac{1}{\pi} \sum_{\ell=1}^{M} 
    \frac{\rr \cdot \llambda_\ell^\perp}{\rho^2},
\end{align*}
and the vorticity of a rotlet is zero.  Therefore, the vorticity at $\xx
\in \Omega$ is
\begin{align*}
  w(\xx) = w^\DD(\xx) + w^S(\xx).
\end{align*}
To compute~\eqref{eqn:vorticityDLP} numerically, we apply the trapezoid
rule with an upsampling scheme described in Section~\ref{sec:NSI}.

For the Stokes equations, on boundaries that have a no-slip boundary
condition, the shear stress is equivalent to the vorticity $w = v_x -
u_y$.  Therefore, we do not need to compute the vorticity for $\xx \in
\bd\Omega$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Pressure}
\label{sec:pressure}
To compute the pressure at $\xx \in \Omega$, we follow the
same procedure used for the shear stress.  We start by computing the
pressure of the double-layer potential for $\xx \in \Omega$ and add the
appropriate jump if $\xx \in \Gamma$. For $\xx \in \Omega$, the pressure
is
\begin{align}
  p^{D}(\xx) = -\frac{1}{\pi}\int_{\bd\Omega} \frac{1}{\rho^2}
    \left(I - 2 \frac{\rr \otimes \rr}{\rho^2}\right) 
    \nn \cdot \eeta(\yy) \,ds_\yy.
    \label{eqn:pressureDLP}
\end{align}
The pressure due to the Stokeslets is
\begin{align}
  p^S(\xx_0) = \sum_{\ell=1}^{M}\frac{\rr \cdot \llambda_\ell}{2\pi\rho^2},
  \label{eqn:shearPressureSR}
\end{align}
and the pressure due to the rotlets is zero.  Therefore, the pressure is
\begin{align*}
  p(\xx) &= p^{\DD}(\xx) + p^{S}(\xx), \quad &&\xx \in \Omega,\\
  p(\xx) &= \pderiv{\eeta}{\ss} \cdot \ss + p^{\DD}(\xx) + 
              p^{S}(\xx), && \xx \in \bd\Omega.
\end{align*}
To compute~\eqref{eqn:pressureDLP} numerically, we apply the trapezoid
rule with an upsampling scheme described in Section~\ref{sec:NSI}.

To compute the pressure at $\xx_0 \in \bd\Omega$, we consider the limit
as $\xx$ tends to $\xx_0$.  The limiting value is given
by~\cite{qua-bir2014a}
\begin{align}
  \lim_{\substack{\xx \rightarrow \xx_0 \\ \xx \in \Omega}}p^\DD(\xx) =  
    \pderiv{\eeta}{\ss} \cdot \ss + p^{\DD}(\xx_0).
  \label{eqn:pressureJump}
\end{align}
Similar to the shear stress, the singularity of the pressure
corresponding to the double-layer potential~\eqref{eqn:pressureDLP} is
too strong for the trapezoid rule to be directly applied.  Therefore, we
again subtract a constant density function and write the pressure as
\begin{align*}
  p^\DD(\xx) = -\frac{1}{\pi}\int_{\bd\Omega} \frac{1}{\rho^2}
    \left(I - 2 \frac{\rr \otimes \rr}{\rho^2}\right) 
    \nn \cdot (\eeta(\yy) - \eeta(\xx)) \,ds_\yy, 
    \quad \xx \in \bd\Omega
\end{align*}
Then, identical to how the shear stress is
computed~\eqref{eqn:stressOddEven}, odd-even integration is used to
evaluate this layer potential for pressure.  The pressure due to the
Stokeslets are given in equation~\eqref{eqn:shearPressureSR}.  Finally,
to add the jump condition~\eqref{eqn:pressureJump}, Fourier
differentiation is used to compute the arclength derivative. 


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Drag}
\label{sec:drag}
\todo[inline]{check all signs in this section.  Fortran code assumes a
normal pointing into the eroding body and a tangent vector that
corresponds to a couterclockwise parameterization}
With the pressure and shear stress, the drag on a single body with
boundary $\gamma_\ell$ is
\begin{align}
  F_D = \int_{\gamma_\ell} (-p \nn + \tau \ss)\,ds.
  \label{eqn:drag}
\end{align}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Near-singular integration}
\label{sec:NSI}
The layer potentials for the~\eqref{eqn:velocityDLP},
vorticity~\eqref{eqn:vorticityDLP}, and pressure~\eqref{eqn:pressureDLP}
need to be evaluated at points $\xx \in \Omega$. We write the general
layer potential as
\begin{align}
  \phi(\xx) = \int_{\bd\Omega} K(\xx,\yy) \eeta(\yy) ds_\yy.
  \label{eqn:genericLP}
\end{align}
Since the integrand is periodic and smooth, the trapezoid rule
guarantees spectral accuracy.  However, when the target point $\xx$ is
close to $\bd\Omega$, the integrand is nearly-singular, and the accuracy
of the trapezoid rule deteriorates unless a large number of
discretization points are used.  We are only interested in computing the
velocity, vorticity, and pressure to visualize the flow, so it is not
necessary that we resolve the integrands for arbitrarily close target
points

The layer potential~\eqref{eqn:genericLP} is approximated with the
trapezoid rule 
\begin{align}
  \phi(\xx) = \sum_{j=1}^N q_j K(\xx,\yy_j),
  \label{eqn:layerPotential}
\end{align}
where $q$ contains the quadrature weights, Jacobian, and density
function.  Based on numerical experiments, the error of the $N$-point
trapezoid rule is acceptable for points $\xx$ that are more than 5
arclength spacings from $\bd\Omega$.

For points that are closer than 5 arclength spacings to $\bd\Omega$, we
use an upsampled trapezoid rule.  The required upsampling of the
geometry and the density function is done with a Fourier interpolant.
To minimize the number of discretization points that are used to
approximate the layer potential~\eqref{eqn:layerPotential}, we use the
same upsampling rate for all target points that are in the same dyadic
interval (Table~\ref{tbl:upsampling}).  For points that are closer than
$5/16$ of an arclength from $\bd\Omega$, a value of 0 is simply assigned
to $\phi$.

\end{table}

In future work, upsampling will not be adequate.  For example, if
eroding bodies are also sedimenting, bodies will come too close to one
another for upsampling to only used.  Therefore, we plan to implement a
near-singular integration scheme that uses either near-singular
interpolation~\cite{qua-bir2014a}, quadrature by
expansion~\cite{klo-bar-gre-one2013}, Barycentric
interpolation~\cite{bar-wu-vee2015}, or panel-based
quadrature~\cite{hel-oja2008a}.

\section{Results}
\label{s:results}
With the description of the methods complete, we now present numerical results on bodies eroding in Stokes flow. We first discuss the case of a single eroding body, as certain features can be predicted analytically and thus used for validation. We then discuss the erosion of multiple bodies and highlight important differences compared to the single-body case.

\subsection{Shape evolution of a single eroding body}

%^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^%
\begin{figure}%[htbp]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width = 0.80 \textwidth]{./figs/01bodseq.pdf}
\caption{A single body eroding in Stokes flow. As the body erodes, it develops a corner at its front and rear stagnation points, while remaining for-aft symmetric due to time-reversibility. Color indicates the vorticity of the surrounding flow, which, when evaluated on the boundary, gives the local shear stress. In this simulation, we use $N_\iin = 1024$ discretization points on the body, $N_\out = 1024$ points on the outer boundary, a time-step of $\Dt = 1E-6$, and smoothing parameters of $\eps = 10/1024$ and $\sigma = 10/1024$.}
\label{01bodseq}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{01bodseq} shows the erosion of a single body, numerically simulated with $N_\iin = 1024$ discretization points, and shown at three evenly spaced times. Here, color represents the vorticity of the surrounding flow, which, when evaluated on the boundary, indicates the shear stress and thus the local erosion rate. As seen in the left-most snapshot, the body is initially circular and has the strongest vorticity above and below it. The flow is for-aft symmetric as a result of the time-reversibility of the Stokes equations and vorticity vanishes at the body's front and rear stagnation points. At the next instance, the body has lost material due to erosion, but remains for-aft symmetric due to the flow symmetry. The greatest material loss has occurred at the body's top and bottom, where shear is strongest. Interestingly, the body has developed well-defined corners at its front and rear stagnation points. This geometric feature is a consequence of the erosion law, which depends on the {\em absolute} shear stress: wherever the stress vanishes, $\atau$ exhibits a corner, which manifests as a corner in the geometry. As shown in the third snapshot, this corner persists as the bodies becomes even more slender while wasting away. In this simulation, the body completely vanishes at a final time of $t_f = 1.79E-2$.

To better understand the body's shape evolution in this simulation, Fig.~\ref{shrink_intface}(a) shows several superimposed interfaces at evenly spaced times. The interfaces are color-coded by normalized time $t/t_f$. The body seems to converge to a shape that resembles an American football -- a fairly slender, for-aft symmetric shape with corners at the front and back. Fig.~\ref{shrink_intface}(b) shows how the absolute shear stress, $\atau$, is distributed along each of these interfaces. The normalized arc length $s/L$ runs counterclockwise around the body, with $s/L = 0$ corresponding to the rear stagnation point and $s/L = 0.5$ the front stagnation point. At early times (yellow to orange), the stress is distributed non-uniformly, with highest values at the top and bottom of the body. As time proceeds, though, the stress becomes more evenly distributed along the body's surface (red). As the body nears the final stages of erosion (dark red), the stress actually becomes slightly higher near the stagnation points. A close look reveals that {\em at} the stagnation points, the stress always vanishes, though in a region that becomes increasingly narrow.

\subsection{Scaling law for the vanishing rate}

Interestingly, a brief look at Fig.~\ref{shrink_intface}(a) reveals that the spacing between successive interfaces becomes larger as the body shrinks, suggesting that the overall shear stress is growing. Of course, such a relationship is consistent with the well-known 3D Stokes drag law, $\tau \sim \mu \umax / L$, since stress is inversely proportional to body scale $L$. This law must be modified in 2D, though. The modification is made non-trivial by subtleties associated with the Stokes paradox, but can be correctly deduced by noting that, as the body vanishes, its drag must be consistent with slender-body theory. For a slender body in flow perpendicular to its long-axis $W \gg L$, the drag is proportional to $\mu \umax W/ \log(W/L)$. This relationship implies that, for a 2D cross-section perpendicular to the long axis, the stress (per unit $W$) can be estimated by
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:stresslaw}
\tau \sim \frac{\mu \umax}{L \log(W/L)}
\end{equation}
In interpreting our 2D simulations, we will treat $W$ as fixed and must remember the requirement $W \gg L$.

Now, the body's rate of area reduction is given by integrating the absolute shear stress around the boundary
\begin{equation}
\dot{A} = \int_{\gamma} \atau \, ds \, ,
\end{equation}
which gives the exact relationship
\begin{equation}
\dot{A} = \mean{\atau} L \, .
\end{equation}
Thus, the area-loss rate is given by the product of the mean shear $\mean{\atau}$ and the total perimeter $L$. Inserting the scaling law \eqref{eq:stresslaw} gives
 \begin{equation}
\dot{A} \sim \frac{\mu \umax}{\log(W/L)} \, .
\end{equation}
Noting that $A \sim L^2$ allows one to solve this ODE to get
\begin{equation}
A (1 - \log A) = C (t_f - t)
\end{equation}
This is an {\em implicit} relationship for how the area scales down in time during erosion.

\todo[inline]{Define $C$; also maybe need to use a different letter.}



In Fig.~6a, we show the body area vs time measured in the simulation
against the above scaling law. In the scaling law, we chose, $C = 0.42$
(check this?)

\subsection{The limiting shape}

With the vanishing rate understood, we now seek to quantify the limiting shape formed by a single eroding body.

% Pozrikidis page 239: symmetric flow.
Certain features of this shape can be predicted analytically by appealing to the principal of uniform stress distribution. In particular, consider the angle formed at the front and rear stagnation points. In long time, the stress becomes uniform, in particular in a small vicinity of this front angle in which body curvature can be ignored. Zooming in on the front angle, we can consider the problem of Stokes flow around an infinite wedge of opening angle $\oangle$. Exact solutions can be obtained to this problem via separation of variables in polar coordinates $(r, \theta)$ \cite{poz1997}. In this section alone, $\theta$ denotes the polar angle and not the tangent angle of the body.
The corresponding stream function is $\psi = r^{\lambda}f(\theta)$, where $f$ satisfies the 4th order ODE
\begin{equation}
f'''' + 2(\lambda^2 - 2 \lambda + 2)f'' + \lambda^2(\lambda-2)^2 f = 0
\end{equation}
This ODE is subject to no-slip boundary conditions along the wedge $f(\thb) = f'(\thb) = 0$, where $\thb = \pi - \oangle/2$, along with the condition of odd-symmetry $f(0) = f''(0) = 0$ (corresponding to up-down symmetry of the flow).
The corresponding shear stress evaluated on the surface of the wedge is $\tau = \mu r^{\lambda-2} f''(\thb)$. Thus, the wedge of uniform stress corresponds to $\lambda = 2$. For this value, the solution for $f$ satisfying odd symmetry is
\begin{equation}
f(\theta) = B \sin (2 \theta) + C \theta
\end{equation}
Then the eigenvalue problem
