First example is single body
   - plots of length and opening angle when area kept fixed as a
     function of time
   - area/aspect ratio as a function of time for shrinking bodies
   - steady state shape
   - drag/resistivity as a function of time
   - drag/resistivity as a function of rotation angle
   - convergence study

Example 1.5
    - two bodies with one very large and one small close by

Second example is 8-10 bodies
  - vorticity
  - streamlines ie. tracers
  - plot of area as a function of time for each body
  - volume fraction as a function of time.  Is it similar to multiple
    bodies

Thrid example is 30 bodies
  - Show snapshots
  - Show resistivity and drag versus time
