The PI and co-PI have successful reduced the budget for this project form $439,192 to under $250,000. The reduction will have some impact on the scope of the project, but we are certain that we will still be able to meet the main goals of the project. First, the largest change is that instead of partially supporting two graduate students for the 3 years, only one graduate student will be supported. This graduate student will spearhead the implementation of novel numerical algorithms for simulating flow-induced erosion with multi-physical effects to be used in the modeling of groundwater systems and sinkhole collapse. The graduate student will also explore machine learning techniques in order to inform reduced models that learn from batches of high-fidelity simulations. Thus, the main computational thrust of the project will remain intact and largely unmodified.

In order to cut the budget, we removed all expenses pertaining to the laboratory experiments that were originally intended to corroborate and interplay with the numerical simulations. The cuts include the second graduate student, the funding for an undergraduate student, the funding for the technical person, and a large portion of the materials and supplies. While the laboratory component would have been a nice addition to the project, its role was not as essential as the computational component, and could possibly be replaced by a collaboration with other, external experimentalists.

In addition, we have cut 1/2 month of summer salary support for co-PI Quaife. We have retained the originally requested summer salary for PI Moore since, with the cut second graduate student, the PI will need to take on some additional burdens of the project.

We have also significantly scaled back the travel support as COVID-19 may likely curtail the ability to travel anyway.
