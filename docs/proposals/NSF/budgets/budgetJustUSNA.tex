\subsection*{A: Senior Personnel (co-PI: Matthew Moore)}
%\hfill \\
%\noindent
The requested senior personnel funding is to support one month of 
co-PI Moore's summer salary in each of years 1--3. During this period, the PIs
will work together to develop and implement algorithms, write papers,
and work closely with the graduate student. 
Co-PI Moore's salary will in years 1,2,3 will be USNA Step 30, 31, and 32 respectively, with the monthly salaries listed in the table:

\subsection*{E: Domestic Travel}
%\hfill \\
%\noindent
The requested travel funds is to partially fund a domestic trip
for co-PI Moore in years 2 and 3.  The expected costs per
conference participant is $\$1,750$ with a breakdown of $\$600$ for
airfare, $\$750$ for lodging, $\$56$ for local transportation, $\$144$
for meals (four days at $\$36$ per day), and $\$200$ for conference
registration.  Potential meeting venues include several SIAM Meetings
(Annual Meetings, CSE, Dynamical Systems), APS Fluids Meetings, or
appropriately themed workshops. 
Alternatively, co-PI Moore may use these travel funds to visit PI Quaife and the funded graduate student at FSU in order to collaborate on the project.
Travel funds for the first year are removed due to the COVID crisis.
