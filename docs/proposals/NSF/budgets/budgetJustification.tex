conference participant is $\$1,750$ with a breakdown of $\$600$ for
airfare, $\$750$ for lodging, $\$56$ for local transportation, $\$144$
for meals (four days at $\$36$ per day), and $\$200$ for conference
registration.  Potential meeting venues include several SIAM Meetings
(Annual Meetings, CSE, Dynamical Systems), APS Fluids Meetings, or
appropriately themed workshops.  The PI, co-PI, and Ph.D.~student will
give presentations and actively participate in the meeting or workshop.
