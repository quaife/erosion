airfare, $\$300$ for lodging, $\$56$ for local transportation, $\$144$
for meals (four days at $\$36$ per day), and $\$200$ for conference
registration.  Potential meeting venues include several SIAM Meetings
(Annual Meetings, CSE, Dynamical Systems), APS Fluids Meetings, or
appropriately themed workshops.  Alternatively, co-PI Moore may use
these travel funds to visit PI Quaife and the funded graduate student at
FSU in order to collaborate on the project.
