\subsection{Synergistic Activities}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt,parsep=0pt,partopsep=0pt] 
  \item Organized a 2017 5-day workshop at the Banff International
    Research Station (BIRS) on complex creeping flows.

  \item Supervised two high school students for six weeks in the summer
    of 2016 through the Young Scholars Program.  They studied the effect
    that regularized kernels have on particle dynamics. 
  
  \item Supervising undergraduate projects on simulating the dynamics of
    particles on closed surfaces, simulating wildfires with cellular
    automata, and using Bayesian analysis to study ocean circulation.

  \item Organizer and co-organizer of multiple minisymposiums at SIAM
    meetings and one SIAM regional meeting.

  \item Developed the courses {\em ISC5238: Integral Equation Methods}
    and {\em ISC5935: Iterative and Direct Methods for Linear Systems}.
