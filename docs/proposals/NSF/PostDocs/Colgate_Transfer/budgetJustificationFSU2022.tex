(four days at $\$36$ per day), and $\$200$ for conference registration.
An additional $\$523$ is budgeted for year 3. Potential meeting venues
include several SIAM Meetings (Annual Meetings, CSE, Dynamical Systems),
APS Fluids Meetings, or appropriately themed workshops. The PI and
Ph.D.~student will give presentations and actively participate in the
meeting or workshop. Travel funds for the first year are removed due to
