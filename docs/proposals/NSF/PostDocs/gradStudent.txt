The proposal will support Jake Cherry, a Ph.D. student at Florida State University. Jake is a white American male with no minority status. His Ph.D. start date was August 2019, and thus far he has been supported by teaching assistantships. Jake passed the written component of the preliminary exam in May 2020. I have no concerns that he will successfully pass the oral component in September 2020. Jake is currently familiarizing himself with the methods to perform the proposed research, and his research will focus solely on this project. I expect Jake to graduate in Summer 2023 or Summer 2024.
