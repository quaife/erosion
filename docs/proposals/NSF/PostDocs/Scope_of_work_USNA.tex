\begin{document}
\section*{Personnel}
The research at the US Naval Academy will be performed by co-PI Moore.

\section*{Deliverables}
The deliverables from the US Naval Academy will include algorithms,
computational tools, peer-reviewed publications, presentations at
conferences, and outreach. The deliverables will be centered around the
following tasks taken directly from the Project Description. 

\paragraph{1: Characterizing anisotropy, permeability, and pore size
dynamics to inform homogenized models such as Darcyâ€™s relation.}
Resistivity of eroded and dissolved bodies will be used define the
anisotropy, permeability, and to infer horizontal permeability.

\paragraph{2: Developing and validating new parameterizations using machine
learning techniques and numerical simulations.} Large batches of
high-fidelity simulations will be used to train machine learning and
deep-neural networks. These new models will parameterize the effects of
erosion on the evolution macroscopic medium properties of the flow.


\section*{Timeline}
Years 1 and 2 will focus on deliverable 1. Years 2 and 3 will focus on
deliverable 2.
