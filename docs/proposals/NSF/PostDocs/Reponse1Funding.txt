1. A statement about other support (by email, all in plain text).
 
Current Support for Moore:

Title: Dynamic interactions between fluid flows and moving boundaries
Source: Simons Foundation, Mathematics and Physical Sciences-Collaboration Grants for Mathematicians
Total Award Amount: $42,000 (Travel funds only)
Duration: September 1, 2017--August 31, 2022
PI Months Committed: 0
Note: This is bridge funding that I cannot hold once I am supported by NSF or another major funding source.

Pending Support for Moore:

Title:  A Comprehensive Experimental And Computational Fluid Dynamics Analysis Of Coning In Non-Newtonian Tailings During Extraction From Tailings Pond
